portal
helps
employees
make
better
and
more
informed
decisions
which
result
from
increased
knowledge
it
also
helps
reduce
costs
saves
time
increases
collaboration
increases
productivity
and
portal
can
help
employees
find
information
more
easily
and
perform
their
jobs
better
though
few
portal
designs
are
optimal
just
in
fact
especially
in
smaller
companies
designers
can
realize
some
features
found
in
portal
software
through
simpler
means
most
intranets
have
become
completely
unwieldy
and
present
a
highly
fragmented
and
confusing
user
experience
with
no
consistency
and
little
navigational
support
portals
aim
to
correct
this
problem
by
presenting
a
single
gateway
to
all
corporate
information
and
services
one
benefit
of
creating
this
consistent
look
and
feel
is
users
need
less
time
to
learn
how
to
use
the
environment
they
also
more
easily
recognize
where
they
are
in
the
portal
and
where
they
can
go
no
small
feat
when
navigating
a
large
information
space
by
integrating
services
and
presenting
personalized
snippets
on
the
initial
screen
intranet
portals
also
reduce
the
need
for
users
to
browse
far
and
wide
to
obtain
needed
information
thus
making
it
easier
for
them
to
perform
their
portal
is
a
tool
that
allows
users
to
create
a
customized
site
that
dynamically
pulls
in
internet
activities
and
desired
content
into
a
single
page
by
providing
a
contextual
framework
for
information
portals
can
bring
st
science
and
technology
and
organizational
knowledge
to
the
disadvantages
edit
portals
can
be
a
large
business
cost
the
maintenance
and
management
can
be
time
consuming
and
expensive
not
only
is
it
a
cost
to
keep
the
portal
running
but
a
cost
when
the
system
goes
offline
most
intranets
are
established
to
put
all
an
organization
resources
into
one
place
and
having
that
offline
can
force
operations
to
be
put
on
issues
can
become
an
ongoing
problem
unauthorized
access
is
a
concern
and
can
result
in
users
gaining
access
to
sensitive
information
denial
of
access
can
cause
issues
for
users
needing
access
for
their
everything
