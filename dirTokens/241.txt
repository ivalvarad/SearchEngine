helps
employees

better

more
informed

,
which
result
from
increased
knowledge

It
also
helps
reduce

saves

find

more

,
though
few
portal
designs
are
optimal
just
out-of-the-box

In
fact
,
especially
in
smaller
companies
,
designers
can
realize
some
features
found
in
off-the-shelf
portal
software
through
simpler
-LRB-
do-it-yourself
-RRB-
means
.
Most
intranets
have
become
completely
unwieldy
and
present
a
highly
fragmented
and
confusing
user
experience
,
with
no
consistency
and
little
navigational
support
.
Portals
aim
to
correct
this
problem
by
presenting
a
single
gateway
to
all
corporate
information
and
services
.
One
benefit
of
creating
this
consistent
look
and
feel
is
users
need
less
time
to
learn
how
to
use
the
environment
.
They
also
more
easily
recognize
where
they
are
in
the
portal
and
where
they
can
go
--
no
small
feat
when
navigating
a
large
information
space
.
By
integrating
services
and
presenting
personalized
snippets
on
the
initial
screen
,
intranet
portals
also
reduce
the
need
for
users
to
browse
far
and
wide
to
obtain
needed
information
,
thus
making
it
easier
for
them
to

Portals

be
a

The
maintenance

management

be
time

Not

is
it
a
cost
to
keep

portal
running
but
a
cost
when
the

Most
