then

talk
july
the
first
hook
is
great
but
the
article
is
sourced
to
only
one
source
which
could
lead
to
a
question
of
notability
is
anything
more
written
about
her
yoninah
talk
august
is
much
but
in
german
which
i
do
speak
if
i
understand
correctly
a
single
source
is
far
from
ideal
but
not
an
insurmountable
issue
surtsicna
talk
august
utc
my
understanding
per
that
a
single
source
may
be
sufficient
for
an
obscure
topic
such
as
an
extinct
species
but
not
for
a
biography
perhaps
you
could
get
some
help
from
a
german
editor
yoninah
talk
august
would
contend
that
a
century
countess
is
a
rather
obscure
topic
as
well
an
english
language
generally
considered
reputable
has
some
info
about
her
would
that
help
the
cited
source
is
the
only
comprehensive
biography
of
the
subject
surtsicna
talk
august
did
a
bunch
of
online
searches
and
i
see
your
dilemma
however
since
you
have
most
of
her
biography
down
i
think
you
should
access
one
or
two
of
those
german
sources
using
google
translate
to
add
a
few
more
cites
the

does
look

surtsicna
have
you
managed

get
any
further
with
this
prioryman

there
rather
more
sources
when
you
look

helfenstein
additional
note
you
can
also
go
by
wp
and
beg
for
some
help
with
the
now
that
said
it
my
understanding
per
what
that
a
single
source
is
insufficient
a
biography
of
a
living
who
might
sue
or
be
damaged
by
inappropriate
treatment
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
notability
but
countesses
count
anyway
and
she
plenty
notable
as
noted
in
german
the
lack
of
english
information
is
just
a
side
effect
of
some
wp
bias
there
no
problem
here
genealogy
websites
on
the
other
hand
are
not
in
any
way
shape
or
form

kind
of

the
need
for

for
a

to
be

october
an
innocent
bystander
here
but
according
to
from
the
and
google
translate
it
does
appear
that
submissions
are
peer
reviewed
the
article
seems
to
have
been
initially
presented
at
a
university
department
roundtable
but
later
published
in
this
journal
nsteffel
talk
october
have
been
terribly
busy
lately
but
i
am
not
sure
i
have
much
to
add
anyway
if
the
source
is
deemed
reliable
and
dyk
rules
do
not
require
more
sources
in
this
case
the
situation
is
as
simple
as
it
can
be
if
it
is
necessary
to
add
aditional
citations
verifying
basic
facts
such
as
her
country
of
origin
name
of
her
husband
possibly
year
of
death
i
suppose
can
do
that
despite
not
speaking
german
i
honestly
do
not
see
the
point
of
using
redundant
lower
grade
sources
other
than
to
formally
satisfy
a
requirement
the
article
does
not
have
the
potential
to
reach
ga
status
but
it
is
dyk
material
surtsicna
talk
october
utc
strikes
me
that
if
someone
died
over
years
ago
but
is
still
being
written
about
they
are
clearly
notable
the
thesis
also
refers
to
a
century
historian
who
studied
her
however
i
would
want
a
clear
description
of
the
one
currently
cited
source
before
this
nom
went
any
further
if
it
was
published
in
an
academic
journal

article
is
new
days
old
long
enough
at
characters
of
prose
and
there
are
no
copyvio
problems
the
main
problem
i
have
is
that
most
of
the
content
is
cited
to
the
tv
episode
itself
which
is
a
bit
weak
i
prefer
a
synopsis
of
the
programme
or
a
feature
on
it
such
as
the
or
itv
own
website
particularly
for
the
key
word
berating
in
the
hook
and
ejection
from
what
exactly
without
that
the
article
does
give
the
impression
of
being
stretched
to
meet
the
character
limit
can
you
find
better
sources
for
the
show
also
roasting
could
do
with
a
link
to
as
i
not
sure
everyone
particularly
brits
are
familiar
with
the
term
outside
of
what
happens
to
chicken
and
beef
in
an
oven
talk
cont
july
would
assume
most
brits
are
familiar
with
the
term
i
a
brit
myself
but
i
added
a
link
neither
the
radio
times
nor
itv
go
into
that
much
detail
on
it
but
as
linked
in
external
links
has
an
article
on
it
their
weaver
week
column
will
probably
cover
that
sort
of
detail
though
they
pledged
to
review
in
next
week
issue
and
i
doubt
they
do
two
reviews
in
a
week
nonetheless
i
fixed
most
of
the
other
issues
disgusted
to
see
that
this
article
is
apparently
the
only
article
on
the

sorry
to
be

but
what
makes
a
reliable

also
how
can
i
verify
the
information
cited
to
the
tv
show
itself
when
it
been
and
gone
from

i
not
saying
you
lying

anything

mistakes

be
made
talk

rather
be

than
have

or
you
can
use

though
i
uneasy
about
providing
a
link
because
most
broadcasters
only
hold
shows
on
their
servers
for
so
long
is
primarily
edited
by
a
man
who
has
years
experience
in
the
field
of
gameshows
and
was
responsible
for
bringing
the

i
consider
him
a
reliable

chba

i
dropped
this
on

do
you
still

shall

yes

do

right
i
picked
this
up
again
i
happy
to
agf
that
the
video
is
an
official
source
that
can
satisfy
everything
in
the
article
is
verifiable
but
could
i
ask
a
quick
favour
and
cite
the
specific
times
in
the
video
each
claim
occurs
not
for
the
general
concept
i
get
that
from
just
a
cursory
look
just
the
round
names
a
swift
and
nasty
exit
and
rules
specifics
then
i
think
we
will
be
good
to
go
sorry
about
the
wait
talk
cont

no

have
a

of

so
i
just
replaced
it
with
its

which
covers
all
the

chba

september
i
think
we
going
round
in
circles
really
sorry
about
the
wait
but
i
think
somebody
else
has
to
have
a
look
at
this
just
to
confirm
i
think
the
main
problem
is
the
article
itself
and
its
verifiability
generally
rather
than
anything
specifically
to
do
with
the
hook
talk
cont

this
article
is
new
enough
long
enough
and
what
is
cited
is
easily
verifable
hook
which
is
catchy
and
cited
the
article
is
neutral
and
free
from
copyright
issues
and
here
hopefully
ends
the
debate

under

i
think
we
need
to
supersede
the
approval
given
the
issues
with
this
new
reviewer
previous
dyk
reviews
as
discussed
at
wt
dyk
this
needs
an
experienced
reviewer
who
is
familiar
with
sourcing
issues
bluemoonset
talk
september
i
do
think
there
is
anything
wrong
with
using
the
show
a
the
source
for
the
description
of
the
gameplay
as
this
is
the
equivalent
of
using
a
film
or
tv
programme
as
the
source
for
the
plot
but
you
have
made
it
quite
confusing
by
citing
the
uk
gameshows
article
as
the
source
repeatedly
in
this
section
when
most
of
the
information
i
guess
still
comes
from
the
show
itself
the
remaining
sourcing
problem
is
that
there
are
no
sources
to
indicate
the
broadcasting
details
this
does
need
clearing
up
before
this
nom
can
be
passed
there
also
seem
to
be
a
lot
more
sources
available
from
extensive
research

done

typing

queen
of

other

roulette

not
right
carousel
could
be
but
i
have
seen
the
show
so
i
ca
say
for
certain
there
no
indication
in
the
episode
list
of
which
of
the
guests
were
the
targets
and
it
is
unclear
if
the
seven
episodes
are
the
complete
series
belle

september
replaced
the

source
with
the

because
itv
take
stuff
off

after
four
weeks
had
i
looked
i
would
have
found
many
of
the

are
routinely
repeated
the
rest
of
the
information
is
offered
here
which
i
add
laun

entirely
sure
what

but
as

been

the
point
is
yet
germane
since

does
have

i
imagine

it
looks

bluemoonset
talk
october
two
and
half
months
down
the
line
this
nomination
seems
to
be
going
nowhere
mainly
because
the
article
is
inadequately
sourced
to
reliable
secondary
coverage
about
the
programme
one
news
article
does
not
make
a
tv
programme
on
a
minor
tv
channel
notable
the
page
is
almost
entirely
unsourced
at
the
moment
suggesting
it
is
more
of
a
fan
page
than
an
encylopedic
article
i
notice
there
is
an
edit
dispute
currently
with
an
ip
editor
removing
all
of
the
primary
sources
the
hook
is
poor
too
it
should
at
least
say
british
television
game
show
or
even
game
show
but
that
is
minor
in
comparison
with
the
major
unresolved
issues
with
the
article
itself
sionk

my

have
had
the
same
treatment
using
inappropriate
guidelines
i
let
this

i
going

have
to
do
something
about
this
systematic
assault
on
my

guidelines
and
wp
gng
for
that
matter
are
pretty
unambiguous
about
what

if

problems
with
other

then
surely
you
should
make
sure
they
meet
dyk
guidelines
before
you
raise
them
for
closer
scrutiny
sionk

meant
having
the
primary

removed
dyk

the
existence
of
a

at
the

of

and
the

keep
being
laun
chba

october

may
have
a
point
but
if

were

it

such
a
major

sionk

not
a

edited

who
has
years
experience
in

was
responsible
for
bringing
the

i
consider
him
a
reliable

i
did
check

see
if
any
of

the

the

you
rather

or
that
the
of

is
a
dua
narrated
by

the

that
the

new

long
enough
inline
citations
and

checks
as
well
good
to
go
i
suggest
using
the
original
babbaq
talk
august
there
currently
no
citation
on
the
fact
that
zayn
narrates
the
dua
which
is
required
by
dyk
criteria
rob
talk
august
are
several
in
the
article
that
indicate
the
hook
is
correct
ref
and
talk
august
the
only
mention
of
zayn
in
the
article
is
in
the
first
sentence
of
the
section
the
narrator
and
this
sentence
does
not
have
an
cite
the
dyk
criteria
requires
an
cite
no
later
than
the
end
of
the
sentence
that
contains
the
hook
fact
also
now
that
i
looking
at
this
more
closely
the
article
appears
to
say
in
the
lead
that
hamza
narrated
this
dua
which
would
contradict
the
hook
fact
this
apparent
contradiction
would
need
to
be
resolved
before
this
hook
runs
or
the
hook
updated
if
you
intended
for
to
be
in
the
hook
rob
talk
august
nominated
two
issues
the
first
is
unclear
for
me
is
it
your
mean
there
is
no
source
to
establish
the
is
a
narrator
of
supplication
if
your
answer
is
yes
i
try
to
find
reliable
source
but
we
can
use
as
hook
is
not
it
abot
the
apparent
contradiction
you
are
right
for
first
time
read
this
supplication
then
abu
hamza
learnt
it
from
imam
and
conveyed
to
other
so
my
question
is
that
who
is
the
or
abu
you
clear
to
me
the
meaning
of
talk
august
does
necessarily
have
to
do
with
whether
you
have
a
source
that
supports
it
just
that
the
information
does
appear
in
the
article
with
an
citation
if
you
wanted
to
do
the
narrator
hook
you
would
need
to
put
that
fact
in
the
article
and
provide
a
source
that
supports
it
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
where
you
put
the
fact
as
for
the
fact
that
zayn
invocated
it
is
in
the
article
and
cited
but
you
would
need
to
add
the
fact
that
he
was
the
fourth
shia
imam
to
the
article
with
a
cite
rob
talk
august
you
clear
to
the
meaning
of
citation
what
would
i
do
to
resolve
the
problem
if
i
put
the
source
after
the
fact
the
problem
is
solved
or
not
do
i
nominated
to
the
hook
in
another
place

source
with
regards
to
when

invocated
the

rob
talk
august
i
pulled
the
hook
from
prep
the

needs
a
thorough
copyedit
before
it
can
be
featured
on
the
main
page
the
final
paragraphs
of
the
chain
of
authority
and
reception
are
particularly
opaque
i
would
like
to
strongly
recommend
that
invocated
not
be
used
in
the
hook
and
article
since
the
hook
is
taken
directly
from
it
since
the
verb
invocate
is
listed
by
dictionaries
as
archaic
and
there
is
probably
a
better
way
to
phrase
it
so
people
wo
stumble
over
an
obsolete
word
bluemoonset
talk
august
my
point
of
view
this
is
barely
english
it
needs
serious
work
and
anyone
who
was
involved
with
accepting
it
for
main
page
inclusion
should
take
a
second
look
seriously
what
the
hell
does
to
croon
a
little
part
of
dua
with
feeling
and
meditate
upon
its
words

nominated

do
read

than
a

the

the

perhaps
someone

should
double
check
this
point
also
in

about

noted

is
new
enough
long
enough
and
has
inline
the
last
sentence
of

he
recommended
reading
this
meaningful
supplication
slowly
and
thinking
about
it
as
one
reads
the
word
meaningful
seems
editorial
enough
to
compromise
npov
i
think
it
should
be
either
quoted
and
attributed
or
replaced
with
a
more
neutral
i
missing
something
very
possible
as
i
am
not
in
islam
but
the
source
cited
for
the
phrase
imam
the
fourth
shia
imam
seems
to
identify
ali
zain
as
the
fourth
imam
if
these
are
two
names
for
the
same
person
i
believe
a
source
should
be
cited
establishing
and
ali

are
one
person
i
replaced

of

invoked
the
supplication
of

hamza
every

dawn
during

the
first
one
appears
to
be
just
a
rendering
of
the
supplication
and
does
not
seem
to
mention
when
the
supplication
was
invoked
i
searched
the
book
for
morning
and
evening
but
could
not
find
substantiation
of
the
second
source
cited
for

okay
i
be
the
fly
in

here
not
being
of
this
faith
it
seems
to
me
the
entire
second
paragraph
in
the

of
the
nominated
article
is
maybe
the
gist
of
the
hook
and
there
a
citation
at

of
the
paragraph
and
the
source
depicts
that
process
by
how
that
happened
did
i
get
that
correct
i
a
little
bit
concerned
this
might
be
perceived
as
somewhat
vague
like
jesus
ascended
to
heaven
because
he
led
a
good
life
if
that
makes
sense
talk
september
as
i
have
been
editing
some
articles
relating
to
and
hinduism
itself
recently
i
also
want
to
join
the
conversation
i
certainly
believe
the
varaha
upanishad
deserves
a
dyk
as
it
is
such
an
important
work
whether
you
are
religious
or
not
in
my
opinion
the
current
dyk
info
is
a
bit
too
general
to
by
catchy
on
its
own
and
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
it
might
not
make
much
sense
to
people
without
much
inside
knowledge
on
the
subject
there
are
so
much
in
this
particular
upanishad
that
will
make
very
interesting
dyks
so
i
have
made
a
small
list
of
examples
here
the
x
year
old
varaha
upanishad
is
the
first
text
to
describe
how
the
om
mantra
washes
away
all
sins
and
assures
the
x
year
old
varaha
upanishad
is
the
first
text
to
elaborately
describe
the
concept
of
brahman
the
yamas
described
in
the
varaha
upanishad
x
years
ago
closely
matches
the
from
the
article
stands
right
now
it
lacks
information
on
its
origin
it
is
truly
very
old
in
the
order
of
years
but
the
article
really
needs
more
information
on
it
as
it
is
that
is
why
i
wrote
the
x
rhinomind
talk
september
reviewer
needed
to
check
the
three
suggested
alt
hooks
and
perhaps
have
a
look
at
the
article
for
what
rhinomind
suggests
is
lacking
talk
september
rhinomind
the
article
is
based
on
translations
of
the
original
sanskrit
text
which
is
dated
between
the
and
centuries
i
have
added
this
fact
in
the
lead
with
a
reference
the
article
is
highly
philosophical
and
runs
into
hymns
i
have
abridged
most
of
it
within
this
article
however
i
have
added
a
few
more
lines
at
the
end
of
lead
which
may
be
interesting
observation
on
the
hook
is
correct
i
do
think
i
can
improve
on
it
further
as
the
subject
is
abstract
i
therefore
suggest
that
hook
suggested
by
rhinomind
with
the
period
mentioned
may
be
considered
for
approval
i
am
suggesting
it
hook
the
dated
between
and
century
is
the
text
that
describes
how
the
om
mantra
washes
away
all
sins
and
assures
nvvchar
september
mentioned
in
the
article
specific
enough
in
wording
and
sourced
striking
the
others
so
the
promoter
does
not
get
confused
does
rhinomind
have
any
comments
talk
september
thanks
for
adding
the
origins
information
nvvchar
and
notifying
me
i
must
say
that
i
am
surprised
it
only
dates
to
the
century
as
most
other
upanishads
are
years
old
or
am
i
completely
off
on
that
one
too
i
better
check
up
on
all
this
it
might
be
that
the
source
you
writes
from
nvvchar
is
a
compilation
with
some
added
verses
from
that
period
while
the
original
text
is
much
older
i
dont
know
and
i
better
discuss
it
on
the
articles
own
talkpage
when
i
have
done
some
proper
research
on
it
yes
the
upanishads
that
are
viewed
as
part
of
the
vedas
are
generally
years
old
written
in
bce
i
have
now
learned
that
there
are
a
plethora
of
more
recent
upanishads
also
but
as
only
some
groups
view
them
as
part
of
the
vedas
they
are
often
called
the
sectarian
upanishads
in
scholarly
terms
guess
you
learn
something
new
every
day
i
have
moved
this
particular
discussion
to
the
proper
talkpage
for
now
rhinomind
talk
september
it
was
i
who
suggested
the
alt
dyk
i
think
its
a
great
idea
but
could
we
perhaps
sharpen
the
dyk
further
with
the
addition
that
it
was
the
first
text
to
describe
or
is
this
not
true
either
i
have
made
a
bummer
with
the
dating
i
guess
so
this
might
also
be
untrue
perhaps
but
then
which
text
did
mention
it
first
then
an
open
and
interesting
question
rhinomind
talk
september
my
three
alts
relies
heavily
on
an
ancient
dating
that
turned
out
to
be
wrong
i
am
not
sure
which
dyk
would
fit
best
i
am
open
to
anything
rhinomind
talk
september
utc
rhinomind
since
nvvchar
is
the
nominator
what
you
are
requesting
here
needs
to
be
approved
as
a
hook
by
him
then
he
needs
to
make
sure
it
mentioned
that
way
and
sourced
in
the
talk
september
rhinomind
i
propose
this
hook
that
the
describes
samsara
cycle
of
birth
life
and
death
as
part
of
one
karma
or
deed
and
is
stated
to
be
a
prolonged
swapna
or
nvvchar
september
my
opinion
counts
i
think
is
too
long
and
even
more
complicated
than
the
original
dyk
and
samsara
is
described
by
so
many
other
texts
varaha
does
not
stand
out
in
this
respect
for
a
dyk
i
think
we
should
pick
something
that
is
unusual
and
at
the
same
time
special
for
varaha
upanishad
perhaps
nvvchars
original
hook
is
the
best
idea
after
all
just
my
thoughts
on
this
rhinomind
talk
september
utc
i
would
prefer
the
original
hook
as
also
suggested
by
rhinomind
i
am
proposing
it
again
with
slight
that
in
the
varaha
pictured
enlightens
sage
ribhu
who
attained
godhood
by
austerities
on
all
scriptural
nvvchar
september
reviewer
needed
to
check
talk
september
i
essentially
this
article
against
all
the
criteria
it
does
need
some
but
nothing
major
and
main
page
exposure
hopefully
attract
some
editors
willing
to
the
article
i
approving
as
it
meets
the
hook
criteria
and
seems
the
most
satisfactory
one
reached
after
long
discussion
i
taken
the
liberty
of
striking
alts
and
and
moving
out
so
that
it
is
more
visible
for
the
prepping
to
what
i
have
october
sorry
but
austerities
on
hindu
texts
makes
no
sense
i
have
had
time
to
check
this
nom
thoroughly
but
at
the
very
least
the
hook
will
need
rephrasing
gatoclass
talk
october
gatoclass
it
actually
austerities
on
hindu
texts
ribhu
who
practiced
austerities
is
being
enlightened
on
all
hindu
texts
no
ribhu
practiced
austerities
on
hindu
texts
even
so
maybe
who
attained
godhood
by
austerities
could
be
reworded
to
who
attained
godhood
through
austerity
or
practicing
to
what
i
have
october
you
for
the
explanation
but
quite
honestly
enlightened
on
all
hindu
texts
does
make
much
sense
to
me
either
especially
given
that
enlightened
usually
has
a
more
specific
meaning
in
this
context
again
i
am
going
to
have
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
article
and
its
sources
before
drawing
any
further
conclusions
gatoclass
talk
october
this
thread
still
active
gatoclass
yes
reading
the
text
carefully
it
all
makes
sense
as
explains
but
i
can
see
that
the
phrasing
is
easy
to
misunderstand
and
it
might
ease
things
if
the
commas
are
simply
replaced
by
dashes
like
that
in
the
varaha
pictured
enlightens
sage
ribhu
who
attained
godhood
by
austerities
on
all
hindu
enlightens
can
mean
many
things
in
a
religious
context
but
here
it
simply
means
enlightenment
as
it
is
used
in
the
context
of
education
varaha
made
sure
ribhu
understood
the
hindu
scriptures
nothing
i
would
not
endorse
this
although
it
seems
a
very
small
thing
austerity
in
christianity
in
particular
has
a
very
specific
meaning
in
a
hindu
context
there
are
many
austerities
to
work
with
they
are
mainly
summed
up
in
the
yamas
these
yamas
are
somewhat
similar
to
the
ten
commandments
in
christianity
so
the
word
austerities
has
a
much
broader
meaning
than
how
the
word
austerity
is
usually
understood
in
a
western
cultural
context
with
just
a
superficial
understanding
of
hinduism
this
aspect
is
clear
not
trying
to
be
condescenting
just
stating
and
explaining
researching
nvvchar
has
made
a
great
contribution
by
writing
up
a
summary
of
this
important
text
in
english
from
the
sanskrit
version
i
am
not
sure
there
is
any
english
translation
of
this
text
available
anywhere
if
you
know
of
or
has
access
to
one
the
article
can
be
greatly
improved
if
you
put
in
a
link
or
rhinomind
talk
october
gatoclass
nvvchar
and
rhinomind
perhaps
a
more
interesting
hook
would
be
that
the
considers
being
born
a
human
male
brahmin
a
blessing
not
easily
achieved
this
would
mean
that
a
citation
would
need
to
be
added
to
the
corresponding
passage
in
the
to
what
i
have
october
for
the
delay
in
returning
to
this
i
was
surprised
by
the
length
of
the
article
and
of
the
upanishad
itself
which
has
put
me
off
a
bit
and
i
have
found
time
to
look
more
closely
at
it
yet
i
think
rhinomind
suggested
fix
for
would
probably
work
and
suggested
alt
would
also
probably
be
acceptable
assuming
it
can
be
verified
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
gatoclass
rhinomind
and
i
have
fixed
reference
to
suggested
by
which
is
in
chapter
ii
hymns
b
a
i
have
also
added
the
original
sanskrit
version
of
the
upanishad
but
there
is
no
verbatim
translation
of
this
text
in
nvvchar
october
having
taken
a
closer
look
at
this
i
ca
verify
which
looks
to
me
like
a
possible
misreading
of
the
underlying
text
suggested
alt
might
work
except
that
the
text
uses
the
term
brahmana
rather
than
brahmin
and
i
do
know
if
they
are
the
same
thing
gatoclass
talk

from
representing

in

is
the
bramhana
a
bramhana
is
essential
for
this
rite
and
so
on
however
in
this
context
i
am
rewording
the
hook
suggested
by
rhinomind
as
that
the
considers
being
born
a
human
male
with
blessings
of
knowledge
of
brahmana

is

not

why

gone

left

quite
unusual
for

considering

that

however
please
speak
up

voice

i
still
accepting

i
have
returned

it
seems
there
are
only
one

two

for
this

one

another
in

if
someone
can
translate
the

the

might
be
verified
that
way
there
is

in
the

that
this
was
the

did
well
at
rewording
most
of
the
close

but
you
did
miss
some
that
the
wording
should
have
been
obvious
to
you
as
too
similar
to

its
instrumentation
of

marimbas
a
bouncing
boogie
bass
pounding

dreamy
vocals
noted
to
be
similar

all
the

is

should
be
either
attributed

changed

the

taken
from

like

than
the

that
the

the
result
sounding
far
like
a

any
of

currently
referencing

this
should
probably
be
converted
to
a
direct

since
you
mentioning

i
concerned
that
you
thought
those

were
close

i
do
think
this

is

ready
for
another

to
take
over
since
they
would
just
tell
you
to
fix
instances
like
those
noted
above
for
future

it
much
easier
to
avoid

from

than

that
the
shelby

pictured
founded

makes
more
varieties
of
synthetic

gemstones
than
any
other
company
in
the
reviewed
and
by
talk
at

be
clear
i
am
not
reviewing
this
nomination
someone
else
will
have
to
do
that
the
reasons
i
not
doing
the
review
are
i
too
new
at
reviewing
dyk
noms
in
my
own
estimation
and
i
going
to
be
going
in
and
trying
to
edit
at
least
one
of
the
articles
so
that
it
has
a
chance
of
passing
npov
as
of
now
much
of
both
articles
reads
like
advertisement
i
have
to
wonder
whether
has
a
business
relationship
with
shelby
gem
factory
larry
paul
personally
i
think
the
hook
would
be
stronger
without
mentioning
kelley
at
all
his
name
in
there
feels
too
promotional
all
that
said
i
have
a
passing
interest
in
gemstones
so
i
feeling
motivated
to
tweak
at
least
the
one
article
to
save
it
from
being
nominated
for
deletion
we
see
what
my
brings
up
for

grammarfascist
talk

grammarfascist
i
am
disturbed
by
your
comment
where
you
wonder
if
seasoned
editor
has
a
personal
business
relationship
with
either
sgf
or
lpk
please
good
and
be
very
careful
with
innuendo
as
for
wanting
to
improve
these
or
any
other

that
what
we
here
for
mate
so
join
in
as
you
please
rosiestep
talk

rosiestep
sorry
i
have
seen
other
editors
come
right
out
and
ask
someone
who
created
an
article
full
of
promotional
language
whether
the
article
creator
had
a
coi
so
i
thought
that
how
it
was
done
how
should
i
have
phrased
it
meanwhile
both
and
i
have
removed
some
of
the
promotional
language
from
the
gem
article
but
i
feel
there
may
still
be
a
bit
too
much
i
think
it
might
help
if
a
third
editor
looked
it
over
so
its
dyk
nomination
does
fail
grammarfascist
talk
september
have
did
you
know
a
few
that
are
multiple
article
hooks
that
range
from
to
in
a
single
line
dyk
i
have
created
five
are
and
have
some
edit
from
my
past
experience
this
article
qualifies
as
a
dyk
as
it
stands
now
of
course
i
do
mind
additional
talk
september
passing
this
along
my
wife
asked
me
why
do
we
go
visit
this
place
it
would
be
an
day
we
have
never
been
there
however
it
sounds
totally
fascinating
got
everything
from
the
talk
september
passing
this
along
also
look
under
to
see
videos
on
how
i
normally
do
research
for
the
articles
i
create
usually
i
use
books
however
some
i
create
from
just
online
sources
like
this
one
also
do
forget
to
look
at
the
newspaper
article
up
on
i
say
from
my
experience
this
article
qualifies
as
a
did
you
know
as
it
stands
talk
september
did
i
mention
that
the
factory
pictures
were
uploaded
to
wikipedia
not
commons
over
years
ago
by
larry
kelley
himself
so
i
guess
if
there
is
a
conspiracy
here
we
have
been
working
on
it
for
almost
talk
september
is
larry
kelley
added
one
of
the
pictures
to
the
article
in
february
of
talk
september
would
matter
even
if
doug
did
know
the
company
and
was
being
paid
by
them
to
write
it
as
long
as
it
reads
neutrally
and
is
sourced
reliably
not
that
i
think
he
is
working
for
the
company
but
still
it
a
lovely
new
article
and
i
checked
what
he
wrote
originally
and
see
nothing
promotional
or
gushing
about
it
september
that
paul
founded
the
gem
pictured
which
makes
more
varieties
of
synthetic
and
gemstones
than
any
other
company
in
the
new
enough
long
enough
citations
and
sources
checks
good
hook
good
babbaq
talk
september
i
am
concerned
that
some
of
the
phrasing
used
is
too
close
to
that
of
the
sources
compare
for
example
the
kelley
article
and
nikkimaria
talk
october
see
this
checking
through
earwig
copyvio
which
words
are
you
concerned
with
and
i
be
glad
to
talk
october
nikkimaria
i
have
copyedited
and
expanded
the
kelley
article
will
this
talk
october
it
still
too
close
one
specific
example
is
kelley
learned
that
making
ruby
laser
rods
was
interesting
but
did
prove
profitable
vs
but
making
rubies
for
laser
rods
while
interesting
did
prove
very
profitable
but
the
problem
is
more
pervasive
than
that
single
phrase
nikkimaria
talk
october
utc
i
continue
to
make
improvements
to
the
kelley
article
talk
october
nikkimaria
i
further
copyedited
and
improved
the
kelley
article
i
have
reduced
the
earwig
copyvio
detector
from
to
confidence
on
all
i
also
double
checked
by
entering
in
each
line
into
google
without
quotes
and
not
once
did
it
come
to
the
website
flaming
success
at
the
shelby
gem
i
would
think
if
there
was
close
phrasing
used
that
it
would
bring
up
that
site
at
least
one
time
on
one
of
the
sentences
will
that
work
for
a
green
talk
october
it
wo
we
ca
rely
on
automated
tools
like
copyvio
detector
to
determine
close
paraphrasing
because
they
are
smart
enough
to
see
what
humans
can
phrases
that
are
close
in
wording
or
structure
but
not
identical
to
the
source
another
example
of
this
from
shelby
gem
factory
these
are
chemically
and
physically
indistinguishable
of
those
unearthed
the
gemstones
have
a
nearly
flawless
composition
because
the
factory
controls
the
ingredients
and
cooking
temperature
it
is
very
rare
to
find
flawless
natural
gems
vs
which
are
chemically
and
physically
identical
to
stones
dug
from
the
ground
most
of
the
gems
we
make
are
nearly
flawless
because
we
control
the
ingredients
and
the
cooking
temperature
larry
says
it
is
rare
to
find
a
flawless
natural
ruby
there
needs
to
be
some
more
significant
rewriting

nice
catch
i
modified
the

i

the

even

avoid
the

am
not
very
keen
on

how
about

the

still
in

years
after
its
first
documented
use
gatoclass
talk
october
does
seem
quite
right
about
i
heavily
lean
towards
jakob
talk
october
problem
with
jakec
is
that
it
just
is
interesting
who
cares
that
a
name
was
misspelled
on
an
official
document
one
time
it
a
yawn
as
a
hook
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
it
a
wordy
yawn
also
we
have
already
featured
at
least
one
other
hook
using
essentially
the
same
fact
i
think
is
a
lot
more
interesting
and
i
see
no
problem
with
it
it
a
fact
that
the
usgs
were
recommending
the
adoption
of
the
spelling
boile
run
years
after
its
first
documented
use
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
is
not
entirely
accurate
it
makes
it
sound
like
the
name
was
in
question
the
whole
time
which
it
was
and
we
do
know
that
is
the
first
documented
use
of
boile
run
it
just
the
first
that
can
be
found
from
publicly
available
online
sources
jakob

october
utc
jakec
it
not
from
publicly
available
online
sources
it
from
a
document
long
before
there
was
any
such
thing
as
online
and
that
usgs
document
states
that
the
name
has
been
in
use
approx
years
and
cites
an
map
so
yes
the
map
must
be
the
first
documented
use
i
guess
you
have
a
point
about
the
still
in
question
phrase
however
try
this
instead
that
government

recommended
adopting
the

talk
at

i
am
not
sure
i
get
the
math
here
at
all
and
i
am
an
engineer
so
the
first
show
had
out
of
celebrity
shows
or
of
all
shows
in
the
original
reviewed
show
had
out
of
or
correct
so
far
i
just
do
see
the
leap
to
i
mean
that
would
mean
it
would
have
to
produce
times
more
celebrity
shows
shows
not
sure
what
gives
us
that
there
was
a
ratio
of
to
i
guess
but
that
not
a
percentage
i
do
get
the
math
and
the
cited
hook
is
not
sourced
either
so
it
hard
to
pass
this
one
on
that
part
alone
if
the
hook
can
be
by
facts
then
maybe
otherwise
i
not
sure
this
could
be
passed
launchballer
i
would
love
a
few
details
on
this
mpj
us

the
two

just
gives
me
a
headache
so
non
celebrity
original

non
celebrity

original

celeb

revival
had
original
celebrity

new
one
ish
celebrity

i
am
not
seeing
how
you
get
the
number
at
mpj
us
september
lost
me
now
the
first
series
contained
just
celebrity
specials
special
per

in
the
revival
series
the
four
series
contain
specials
specials

x
or
minus
laun
chba
ller
september
to
is
not
a
percentage
it
is
a
ratio
and
why
multiply
two
ratios
with
each
other
that
definitly
does
not
turn
it
into
a
percentage
to
me
the
math
is
unclear
potentially
wrrong
and
there
is
no
source
for
it
yes
it
is
synthesized
from
facts
but
the
calculations
are
not
clear
at
all
mpj
us
september
utc
your
logic
the
first
show
had
specials
and
the
new
one
had
specials
since
i
am
trying
to
see
the
math
but
the
jump
from
ratio
to
percent
does
not
make
mpj
us
september
divided
by
or
divided
by
is
converted
to
a
percentage
is
is
more
than
the
of
the
laun
chba
ller
september
utc
get
the
math
until
you
turn
a
ratio
into
a
percentage
straight
up
you
basically
say
that
is
of
that
math
does
not
check
out
at
mpj
us
september
it
is
wrong
right
off
the
bat
should
be
and
which
equals
and
respectively
if
we
follow
your
logic
we
go
to
this
point
i
can
fail
the
dyk
for
being
unsourced
and
not
logical
or
you
can
ask
for
a
second
opinion
on
your
mpj
us
september
utc
alternative
is
for
me
to
produce
another
hook
such
as
that
is
the
only
person
to
have
appeared
in
episodes
of
fifteen
to
presented
by
both
and
however
try
taking
the
ratios
as
fractions
my
logic
is
based
on
to
find
out
how
much
more
the
revival
has
in
comparison
with
the
laun
chba
ller
september
us
go
with
the
alternate
hook
to
avoid
head
aches
the
last
appearance
table
is
unsourced
though
so
that
needs
to
be
addressed
before
the
hook
can
be
considered
sourced
mpj
us
september
laun
chba
ller
september
utc
source
does
not
list
brandreth
as
a
contestant
as
far
as
i
can
mpj
us
september
utc
source
are
you
on
about
either
try
or
if
on
the
episode
guide
watch
celebrity
episode
in
series
they
list
the
contestants
at
the
start
of
the
show
so
it
wo
take
laun
chba
ller
september
it
a
video
i
did
not
even
notice
that
yes
the
video
does
list
him
hmmmm
mpj
us
september
last
thing
what
does
the
colored
squares
refer
to
there
is
no
key
to
indicate
mpj
us
september
utc
was
just
afd
ed
so
this
is
on
hold
until
the
afd
is
over
if
it
is
kept
it
could
still
have
a
mpj
us
september
utc
to
answer
your
question
they
are
gold
silver
and
laun
chba
ller

so
literally
too
obvious
for

to
see
that
mpj
us

that
unbelievable
was

rather
at

you

verified
but
i
need
to
know
more
about
the
sources
used
for
the
hook
facts
for
the
main
hook
the
source
is
a
blogspot
blog
is
de
considered
a
reliable
source
within
the
mexican

community
for
the
second
i
ran
the
source
through
google
translate
and
the
nearest
thing
that
supports
the
hook
fact
is
a
comment
sort
of
asking
the
question
i
think
we
need
a
better
source
than
that
talk
october
utc
it
is
considered
reliable
for
what
it
is
match
results

interviews
with
wrestlers
the

ruiz

writes
about

for
a
number
of
different

that
covers

the
hold

first
of
all
i
want
to
point
out
the
first
picture
in
the
actual
article
showing
morgan

and
referees
holding
the

for

is
that
considered

kidding
also
this
from
my
built

the
final
moments
i
tired
of
so
many
failed
attempts
and
a
third

in

the

knowing
that
weight
nobody
could
help
i
rather
help
the

literally

resisted
loose

held
it
down

could
finally
be
declared

the
hope
that
helps
clarify
mpj

that
helps
with
the
main
hook
which
i
like
more
anyway
my
query
about
the
source
cited
for
is
still
open
though
and
i
rather
not
clear
this
for
takeoff
before
either
a
we
have
resolved
this
or
b
we
decided
to
drop

not

was
a

i
do

jean

should
be

for

sake
but
his

missing
is
not
in
the
way
of
approval
i
though
again
about
the
hook
can
you
add
a
hint
at
early
writing
on
women
rights
for
those
who
do
know
wollstonecraft
and
misogyny
at
least
link
the
latter
which
i
had
to
look
up
our
readership
is
international

i
tried
to
take
the
ideas
and
remove
the
need

about

it
appeared
that
hated
all

possible
i
prefer
the
slightly
quirky
touch
of
said
a
instead
of
the
because
she
was
the
only
one
right
talk
september
utc
fixed
the
link
to
the
misogyny
article
above
grammar
fascist
contribs
talk
october
those
hooks
do
look
right
to
me
i
will
take
a
closer
look
at
this
one
tomorrow
gatoclass
talk
october
for
not
following
up
on
this
one
sooner
both
alts
are
awkward
in
my
opinion
and
inaccurate
i
do
think
either
are
acceptable
the
original
hook
looks
viable
in
terms
of
fact
but
again
is
a
bit
awkwardly
expressed
does
told
about
mean
introduced
to
ie
wollstonecraft
and
i
do
think
you
can
say
she
told
about
the
nature
of
misogyny
either
as
if
she
an
impeccable
authority
she
merely
had
an
opinion
and
wrote
about
it
so
i
think
this
hook
at
least
needs
some
clarification
gatoclass
talk
october
berlepsch
did
indeed
introduce
wollstonecraft
to
german
readers
the
article
says
only
discussed
so
that
would
need
to
be
clarified
then
i
think
the
original
hook
could
be
reworded
to
something
that
aristocrat
von
wrote
about
women
s
rights
and
misogyny
and
introduced
german
readers
to
the
work
of
gatoclass
talk
october
you
telling
us
about
this
or
writing
about
it
i
not
sure
there
is
a
difference
i
quite
happy
with
either
or
even
if
you
are
introducing
your
view
to
us
i
presume
this
difference
is
important
and
i
happy
with
any
of
these
very
similar
interpretations
this
alt
does
address
gerda
objections
who
can
read
de
wiki
however
which
i
feel
have
been
ignored
victuallers
talk
october
utc
think
the
difference
is
that
told
can
mean
a
lot
of
different
things
and
have
different
connotations
whereas
introduced
has
a
more
precise
meaning
however
you
did
confirm
for
me
that
berlepsch
did
actually
introduce
germans
to
wollstonecraft
the
article
still
only
says
she
discussed
for
german
readers
any
chance
you
could
clarify
that
in
the
article
regarding
gerda
comments
they
were
really
objections
rather
suggestions
as
to
how
the
article
might
be
improved
which
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
process
as
i
think
the
article
already
meets
the
criteria
we
really
only
need
to
confirm
the
hook
at
this
point
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
said
i
though
again
about
the
hook
can
you
add
a
hint
at
early
writing
on
women
rights
for
those
who
do
know
wollstonecraft
and
misogyny
this
is
not
about
the
article
and
it
is
the
reason
why
the
hooks
were
written
the
original
hook
said
told
i
would
have
thought
that
translations
might
be
useful
for
introducing
a
writer
to
german
readers
but
maybe
she
was
just
writing
if
you
want
to
insist
on
then
i
suggest
you
change
it
to
the
word
you
like
i
think
introduce
could
have
read
but
discuss
will
do
victuallers
talk
october
utc
added
womens
rights
to
the
hook
and
also
aristocrat
as
i
think
it
adds
to
the
interest
how
does
it
look
now
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
watching
on
vacation
please
do
change
hooks
which
have
caused
comments
because
it
makes
the
discussion
hard
to
follow
aristocrat
is
redundant
for
readers
who
know
that
the
von
in
her
name
stands
for
that
mentioning
women
rights
and
wollstonecraft
and
misogyny
seems
one
thing
too
many
to
me
please
decide
on
two
of
the
three
is
introduced
now
in
the
article
and
sourced
talk
october
utc
would
you
prefer
to
see
in
the
hook
misogyny
or
womens
rights
regarding
the
introduced
the
article
states
that
discussed
various
writers
for
german
readers
including
particularly
mary
wollstonecraft
she
notes
her
similar
role
in
raising
these
subjects
for
the
first
time
in
if
she
raised
these
subjects
for
the
first
time
in
german
then
she
introduced
them
to
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
rights
better
than
a
word
i
never
heard
before
but
that
just
me
you
might
convince
me
that
it
is
a
catchy
term
and
the
source
indeed
says
that
she
gave
what
she
fought
that
name
as
for
first
time
i
ca
access
the
offline
source
and
the
article
says
that
she
regarded
herself
as
the
first
which
makes
first
not
a
fact
i
like
the
phrase
in
source
fighting
against
the
prejudice
that
wants
to
grant
women
neither
a
will
of
their
own
nor
the
courage
to
express
it
but
see
that
it
long
talk
october
utc
to
confirm
the
off
line
source
says
that
she
as
german
readers
may
have
forgotten
wollstonecraft
i
think
this
is
gerda
point
i
do
feel
we
are
dancing
on
the
heads
of
pins
sorry
gerda
that
means
that
we
are
finding
very
tiny
differences
in
meaning
pleased
to
see
gerda
is
involved
as
i
feel
we
are
sending
the
wrong
message
when
we
a
review
by
a
competent
reviewer
victuallers
talk
october
utc
vic
i
must
reject
your
suggestion
that
i
am
nitpicking
but
it
wo
help
move
this
nom
forward
to
have
a
debate
about
that
as
for
sending
the
wrong
message
however
rechecking
of
others
approvals
is
supposed
to
be
standard
procedure
here
at
dyk
and
i
think
it
the
frequent
failure
to
do
so
that
if
anything
sends
the
wrong
message
to
reviewers
so
i
not
going
to
apologize
for
doing
my
job
i
will
concede
though
that
some
of
my
earlier
comments
on
this
thread
were
unintentionally
blunt
due
in
part
to
tiredness
and
an
at
times
very
slow
editing
window
on
this
pc
which
is
very
frustrating
to
use
so
i
will
apologize
for
that
now
can
we
please
try
to
get
back
to
finding
a
hook
we
can
all
agree
on
how
about
we
just
went
with
something
that
von
is
considered
an
early
proponent
of
women
s
rights
in
germany
the
article
says
as
much
in
the
intro
though
it
would
need
to
be
cited
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
is
a
summary
of
cited
material
which
i
could
approve
but
i
find
it
a
bit
boring
and
a
bit
misleading
because
readers
unfamiliar
with
the
times
thanks
for
the
infobox
might
expect
rights
to
vote
can
one
of
you
write
a
hook
using
the
quote
which
describes
one
of
her
topics
exactly
i
could
but
then
we
would
need
another
reviewer
talk
october
utc
i
fine
with
going
with
your
proposal
for
a
hook
the
problem
is
that
someone
needs
to
add
it
to
the
article
first
gatoclass
talk
october
utc
i
ca
because
first
to
introduce
a
fact
in

and
then
approve
it
seems
to
go
against
the
rulez
written
or
unwritten

you
are
the
one
who

this

musician

was

until

over
two
weeks
later
however
there
was
a
expansion
of
the

that
began
september
so
i
believe
it
qualifies
as
new
enough
with
a
prose
portion
just
over
characters
it
is
also
long
enough
it
follows
npov
and
uses
inline
citations
of
the
chart
listings
cited
in
the

are
not
the
ones
listed

i
not
sure
how
reliable
they
are
as
sources
are
they
all
the
official
websites
of
the
organizations
that
track
the
charts
or
competing
chart
producers
or
are
some
perhaps
merely
reporting
other
organizations
more
serious
issue
i
discovered
while
reviewing
your
sources
is
that
you
have
not
enough
independent
reliable
sources
that
provide
significant
of
sigala
the
first
digitalspy
article
cited
is
a
mere
mention
while
the
second
digitalspy
article
cited
is
substantive
enough
to
count
towards
notability
it
is
currently
being
cited
for
anything
but
the
details
of
sigala
second
single
you
also
need
to
change
the
ref
name
of
one
or
the
other
to
correct
that
ref
error
the
only
other
substantive
coverage
is
from
coda
music
agency
which
appears
to
be
sigala
agent
and
thus
not
independent
i
willing
to
agf
that
sources
to
establish
notability
exist
enough
to
not
nominate
the
article
for

though
another

might

i
do

thought
after

just
touch
this

up
a
bit
instead
i
wound
up
expanding
it
enough
to
make
this
nomination
expanded
by
talk

the
article
has
been
expanded
and
seems
reasonably
compliant
with

i
less
happy
with
the

their
sourcing
seems
ok
but
they
are
a
bit
dull
and
i
reckon
we
can
do
better
i
be
suggesting
another
alt
but
ca
approve
that
myself
there
no
qpq
but
i
not
sure
how
many
dyks
the
nominator
has
done
and
there
might
be
an
issue
with
the
picture
of
the
road
sign
as
it
is
text
in
a
particular
visual
form
which
is
sold
commercially
as
a
souvenir
there
might
be
some
intellectual
property
rights
to
consider
to
be
safe
we
should
use
a
picture
which
shows
the
street
more
than
just
the
sign
talk

utc
is
a
qpq
see
reviewed
above
as
for
the
street
sign
that
the
one
the
city
placed
even
if
it
were
text
in
a
common
font
that
does
make
a
complete
sentence
i
think
is
ineligible
for
copyright
in
both
the
us
and
canada
we
would
have
commons
otherwise
talk
october
utc
for
pointing
out
the
qpq
i
have
trouble
registering
the
word
reviewed
as
meaning
the
same
thing
i
take
your
point
about
the
copyright
issue
and
would
be
happy
to
pass
on
this
aspect
myself
that
just
leaves
the
hook
to
be
decided
talk

that
ass

formerly

because
it

that
yellowknife
ass
pictured
was
formerly
known
as
privy
road
because
it
had
many
outhouses
the
city
it
in
to
the
hook
always
a
good
idea
to
tell
people
where
these
places
are
talk
october
utc
taken
it
out
again
my
thinking
is
that
hooks
should
be
brief
so
that
the
reader
can
easily
grasp
them
and
should
be
mysterious
so
that
the
reader
is
intrigued
and
clicks
through
to
the
article
talk
october
but
i
also
think
that
not
at
least
giving
a
clue
where
something
like
this
is
constitutes
talk
october
utc
need
a
third
opinion
in
any
case
to
choose
between
the
hooks
i
not
understanding
your
point
about
bias
we
providing
a
clue
by
giving
them
a
link
to
click
the
more
we
tell
them
in
the
hook
the
less
likely
they
are
to
click
through
on
the
link
anyway
let
see
what
the
next
reviewer
says
talk
october
point
is
that
we
are
assuming
everyone
who
reads
dyk
lives
in
north
america
an
assumption
some
people
resent
because
it
not
true
i
written
a
lot
of
nrhp
articles
about
historic
places
and
always
always
in
the
hook
i
have
included
at
least
the
city
and
state
i
do
think
it
will
make
much
of
a
difference
as
far
as
the
mystery
goes
because
a
most
canadians
know
yellowknife
is
one
of
their
country
territorial
capitals
but
might
not
be
sure
of
which
one
especially
since
nunavut
was
sawed
off
the
nt
years
ago
b
most
americans
might
know
yellowknife
is
somewhere
in
canada
but
not
much
more
than
that
and
c
outside
of
north
america
the
name
yellowknife
wo
ring
any
bells
just
my
ahem
case
talk
october
utc
the
third
opinion
do
assume
everyone
worldwide
knows
what
country
or
sport
you
talking
supplementary
the
practice
at
dyk
is
that
if
the
nominator
does
like
the
wording
of
a
suggested
alt
then
the
alt
is
struck
and
the
nomination
moves
on
talk
october
utc
so
i
have
put
yellowknife
back
in
really
while
the
original
is
my
personal
preference
if
used
with
the
street
sign
picture
it
will
get
clicks
due
to
its
direct
focus
on
the
road
unusual
name
i
usually
defer
to
whoever
puts
it
in
the
set
and
now
i
have
no
problem
with
if
that
what
we
want
to
go
with

daniel
prefers
his
original
hook

fine
and
understandable
as
we
still
do
have
agreement
on
any
hook
i
have
created
two
versions
of

so
readers
may
see
the
difference
which
is
in
dispute
note
that
i
make
no
assumption
about
the
reader
knowledge
the
reader
is
obviously
not
expected
to
know
where
a
particular
street
is
the
point
of
the
shorter

is
that
it
is
short
per

recommendation

you
write

please
make

is

sstflyer
was
nominated
within

more

within

particularly
as
to
neutrality
use

and
based
on
spot
checks
avoidance
of
close
paraphrasing
or
other

issues
however
like
to
see
a
citation
for
the

the

fulfilled
the

ambitions
to
incorporate
electric
instruments
into
their
music
effectively
melding
the
instrumentals
and
pioneering
an
early
template
for
the
musical
subgenre
of
acid
would
also
be
desirable
for
all
the
while
the
group
looked
to
capitalize
on
the
momentum
from
woodstock
and
their
appearance
in
the
film
zachariah
by
releasing
their
fifth
album
in
may
formatting
of
the
citations
should
be
standardized
particularly
as
some
of
the
works
cited
are
not
in
italics
as
they
should
be
this
does
not
count
against
the
dyk
agree
that
the
original
hook
was
not
sourced
as
well
as
it
should
have
been
and
are
both
strong
hooks
short
enough
and
interesting
enough
i
also
think
the
image
works
equally
well
with
either
alt
however
the
fish
is
barry
melton
nickname
it
should
be
in

marks

suspect
the

the

sentence
is
meant
to
cover
it
and
that
fine
by
normal
wikipedia
standards
but
for
dyk
the
hook
citation
must
come
no
later
than
the
end
of
the
statement
asserting

s
should

since

i
do
feel
comfortable
rewording

in

my

i
also
not

is

addition
i
had
realized
that

subsequent

however
there
was
a
major
issue
with
your

regarding

see
below

now
that
you
have
done
the

review
which
is
the
reason
white

can
qualify

you
can
not

i
confused
about
where
the
articles
came
from
the
edit
summary
that
created
no
kuni
wrath
of
the
white
with
bytes
says
splitting
from
ds
version
this
is
not
at
all
clear
to
many
readers
such
as
myself
and
the
no
kuni
dominion
of
the
dark
creation
summary
of
splitting
from
version
is
similarly
opaque
such
edit
summaries
should
always
contain
a
link
to
the
actual
originated
article
i
think
that
the
material
for
white
witch
came
from
the
main
no
article
and
i
guessing
for
dark
djinn
as
well
but
is
that
the
only
source
for
imported
material
i
like
to
suggest
placing
a
clear
template
to
that
effect
on
both
article
talk
pages
it
looks
like
the
wikipedia
plot
summary
for
white
witch
was
copied
onto
at
least
one
youtube
video
page
but
since
it
dates
from
july
and
the
white
witch
article
was
seemingly
started
in
august
without
that
clear
origin
it
looks
like
wikipedia
did
the
copying
when
it
was
upon
further
investigation
definitely
vice
versa
see
wp
copywithin
for
instructions
on
how
to
fix
this
copyright
problem
especially
in
its
wp
ria
section
which
will
probably
involve
using
the
copied
template
on

both

were
split
off
from
an
earlier

and
as
such
any
material
copied
from
that
article
does
not
count
as
new
and
further
per
wp
dyksg
must
be
expanded
because
white
witch
was
subsequently
made
a
ga
that
supersedes
any
expansion
requirement
looking
at
it
now
it
clearly
did
qualify
as
a
expansion
prior
to
the
ga
listing
but
for
dark
djinn
it
still
holds
be
sure
to
check
what
was
copied
against
the
current
size
of
that
article
of
course
if

should
be

it

from
the

you
can
find
it
here
if
you
do
understand
much
about
the
games
it
a
bit
complicated
to
explain
the
version
of
the
game
of
the
white
is
very
similar
to
the
ds
version
of
the
dark
but
almost
everything
else
graphics
gameplay
is
different
i
think
editors
just
decided
to
write
about
the
games
as
one
article
and
nobody
decided
to
split
the
articles
until
i
came
along
even
though
it
was
discussed
on
the
talk
page
most
of
the
information
from
of
the

is
my
own
original
text
i
adapted
the
gameplay
section
and
edited
the
plot

everything
else
is

all

thanks

the
word
pendant
in
the
case
of
paintings
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
paintings
form
a
pair
a
painting
series
but
not
a
larger
series
than
and
are
meant
to
hang
together
the
supporting
articles
about
the
paintings
individually
quote
the
expert
hofstede
de
groot
who
refers
to
them
explicitly
as
pendants
of
each
other
though
the
word
pendant
may
be
missing
from
the
current
sources
in
this
article
i
do
see
a
need
to
include
a
specific
reference
for
this
word
as
it
is
so
common
in
this
context
the
nytimes
source
does
say
that
the
only
comparable
rembrandt
is
the
aristotle
which
sold
for
million
in
that
makes
it
a
pretty
safe
bet
to
say
this
is
the
most
expensive
pair
and
the
most
paid
individually
not
sure
what
else
you
can
compare
it
to
this
is
also
the
only

i
linked

premiums

ca
show
the
actual
market
value
of
others
though
i
imagine
the
reason
these
have
appeared
on
the
market
in

is
due
to
this
enormously
expensive
show
of
late
rembrandt

thanks
for
adding
those
quite
interesting
references
i
moved
the

ref
up
too
yoninah
i
think
that
indeed
the
catrina
hooghsaet
portrait
and
its
proposed
price
of
million
euros
is
proof
enough
that
oopjen
portrait
is
the
most
expensive
female
portrait
by
rembrandt
but
again
it
is
more
the
fact
that
these
rembrandts
do
come
on
the
market
at
all
and
certainly
not
as
a
pair
that
fact
in
and
of
itself
means
it
is
a
record
since
the
art
market
in
general
has
exploded
since
the
and
there
have
been
no
rembrandt
wedding
pendants
sold
together
since
that
time
let
me
know
if
you
want
me
to
expand
it
a
bit
about
the
catrina
hooghsaet
portrait
could
use
its
own
article
i
am
especially
intrigued
to
read
that
it
came
on
the
market
after
being
lent
out
to
the
rijksmuseum
which
just
goes
to
prove
my
theory
that
the
insurance
premiums
have
gone
up
so
high
that
it
is
maybe
getting
too
expensive
to
hold
such
paintings
if
you
do
have
the
paying
public
to
help
with
the
costs
of
ownership
jane
talk
october
to
mention
that
in
general
portraits
of
women
are
cheaper
than
portraits
of
men
and
so
the
pendants
are
probably
valued
at
rather
than
but
we
will
never
know
for
sure
and
the
hooghsaet
price
helps
with
that
jane

the

considerably
problematic
in
its

the

is
new
enough
and
barely
long

but
i
can
not
judge
it
as
within

both
article

hook
present
an
exceedingly
point
of

regarding
the
controversial
historical
figure
the
second

is
entirely
unreferenced
whatever
the

is
is
formatted
correctly
it
appears
to
be
taken
from
another

used
shortened

because
of
this
problem
i
can
not
verify

this
is
especially
problematic
because
it
appears
to
take
the

value
which
further
compounds
npov
concerns
indeed
the

title
itself
is
problematic
with
an
alternative
such
as
of
the
church
of

perhaps
being
preferable
if
it

this
is
a

spinout

or
a

and
think
that
was
a
good
thing
to

done
i
do
think
you
have
the
article
carefully
enough
to
notice
that
the
desecration
extended
beyond
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
at
all
and
with
that
sort
of
neglect
request
another

attention
to
this
article
i
have
however
changed
the
hook
on
your
advice
to
make
it
suitable
talk

is
built
on
consensus
you
are
welcome
to
seek
a
second
opinion
although
i
assure
you
that
i
examined
the
article
its
claims
and
its
sourcing
quite
thoroughly
an
appropriately
balanced
neutral
article
on
the
topic
would
need
to
address
scholars
opinions
of
motivations
which
will
probably
need
to
address
his
shifting
religious
allegiances
such
as
concerns
that
the
was
or
that
the
destruction
was
potentially
taken
as
a
consequence
of
the
complex
during
the
a
neutral
article
will
also
need
to
take
a
more
measured
approach
to
the
chain
of
events
connecting
the
destruction
of
the
church
to
the
first
crusade
probably
needs
to
be
addressed
along
with
and
context
needs
to
be
provided
for
their
writings
especially
was
prone
to
hyperbole
or
outright
fabrication
the
first
crusade
causes
were
more
complex
and
nuanced
indeed
was
long
dead
and
the
church
rebuilt
before
the
crusades
were
even
conceived
of
not
all
scholars
agree
whether
its
destruction
was
even
mentioned
by
urban
ii
at
and
finally
it
goes
without
saying
that
a
neutral
article
would
require
neutral
language
this
is
simply
not
hitler
and
the
holocaust
talk
october
for
these
helpful
pointers
it
is
more
complex
than
the
holocaust
i
have
made
an
attempt
to
incorporate
a
lot
of
this
information
with
a
new
motivations
section
and
clarified
the
crusades
talk
october
the
article
is
much
improved
from
the
state
at
its
original
dyk
nomination
but
i
am
still
not
comfortable
approving
this
for
dyk
i
retain
the
belief
that
the
title
is
problematic
and
that
some
of
the
phrasing
especially
but
not
limited
to
abomination
of
desolation
is
far
from
neutral
it
remains
my
opinion
that
this
is
not
suitable
but
the
nominator
has
requested
a
third
party
reviewer
and
i
have
no
objection
to
someone
else
giving
the
article
due
consideration
talk

you
for
your
valuable
contribution
squeamish
much
appreciated
i
have
taken
the

up

and
further
discussion
is
welcome
there
not
limited
to
that
but
other
possibly
problematic
phrasing
i
am
open
to

i
understand
your
concerns
about
title
and
am
open
to
discussion
about
that
also
the
hook
this
article
has
become
a
bit
of
a
whodunit
case
since
i
started
it
after
a
lot
of
researching
it
seems
likely
in
my
opinion
that
did
likely
have
a
christian
mother
and
did
likely
execute
his
uncle
arsenius
patriarch
of
jerusalem
as
part
of
the
desecration
for
the
holy
fire
fraud
on
the
suggestion
of
the
disenchanted
christian
monk
john
making
the
whole
matter
a
lot
more
involved
than
generally
understood
prior
to
writing
the
article
i
think
this
clarification
of
multiple
complicity
actually
presents
a
great
message
of
peace
right
now
with
everything
going
on
with
muslims

had

however
let
see
what
bluemoonset
thinks
about

mhhossein

utc
this
article
can
be
extended
at
any
length
there
are
sectors
in
which
india
gets
fdi
one
can
make
subsection
on
each
sector
and
can
write
paras
on
each
there
are
nations
who
invest
in

whole
details
can
be
written
on
this
as
far
as
history
is
concerned
history
of
fdi
since
independence
of
india
or
even
before
that
can
be
written
so
this
article
can
become
as
long
as
we
want
but
this
much
iprovement
may
takes
week
so
i
nominated
it
within
time
because
it
was
having
characters
and
was
summarizinf
thigngs
article
already
says
fdi
norms
in

have
been
relaxed
points
of
dharmadhyaksha
are
good
as
fae
as
improvement
in
article
is
concerned
but
it
will
take
time
i
have
to
do
some
economic
research
for
that
i
will
improve
article
if
we
follow
dharmadhyakshas
advice
then
article
can
even
get
ga

but
i
think

serves
dyk
purpose
still
i
will
improve

as
much
as
possible
till
it
gets
promoted
for
example
you

can
i

as

there
no
need

the

hook
banana
republic
is
a
direct
quote
from
as
cited
in
the
article
and
not
cited
in
the
article
but
his
images
could
be
used
for
any
relevant
house
member
since
their
headshots
are
by
muboshgu
talk
at
october
this
article
is
new
enough
and
long
enough
the
image
is
in
the
public
domain
the
article
is
neutral
and
no
close
paraphrasing
was
found
my
query
concerns
the
hook
in
the
article
only
a
single
member
has
an
inline
citation
for
his
banana
republic
quip
the
hook
says
members
and
what
exactly
does
the
comment
apply
to
the
house
of
representatives
or
the
process
of
electing
a
speaker
cwmhiraeth
talk
october
added
that
massie
said
banana
republic
to
that
part
of
the
article
their
specific
quotes
and
source
are
massie
this
tell
the
american
people
it
looks
like
a
banana
republic
king
is
total
confusion
a
banana
think
the
comments
refer
to
the
house
itself
but
in
the
context
of
the
election
i
still
open
to
a
better
hook
though
if
there
is
one
muboshgu
talk

this
is
now
good
to
go
cwmhiraeth

no

that

conceived
as
a

that
the

and
one
that
only
one
no
game
was
localized
reviewed
block
to
good
article
status
by
talk
at

promoted
to
ga
in
a
timely
manner
and
certainly
long
enough
and
cited
per
ga
demands
first
hook
is
well
sourced
the
second
does
not
have
a
source
immediately
after
the
information
in
the
article
i
looked
on
the
nearest
reference
to
it
but
could
find
the
information
on
the
third
hook
i
ca
find
affirmation
that
only
one
game
was
localized
reference
does
not
say
which
game
was
localized
it
is
named
in
but
that
has
no
mention
that
it
was
the
only
one
the
first
hook
should
be
good
to
go
if
you
are
preferring
the
alternatives
we
may
have
to
work
on
the
referencing
tad
talk
october
almightey
the
alternatives
are
not
directly
mentioned
in
any
of
the
references
instead
they
implied
through
multiple
references
one
stating
that
of
the
white
was
localised
and
one
stating
that
of
the
dark
was
not
if
this
is
allowed
then
i
very
happy
with
using
the
main
hook
instead
rhain

the

are
slightly
ambiguous
nominator
has
fewer

whether

not
then
the

is
exempt
from

so
i
assume

but

not

the

is
boring
and
is
not
interesting
it
does
even
give
an
example
of
how
or
why
it
received
comparisons
and
this
detail
ca
be
done
in
a
dyk
hook
i
do
understand
why
so
many
clauses
are
being
used
either
because
it
makes
it
longwinded
reading
the
article
a
hook
about
the
song
being
about
underdog
triumphalism
or
raps
the

aspirational
lyrics
with
a
mantra
technique
would
be
far
more
likely
to
grab
my
attention
and
make

it

october
first
of

thank
you
for
fixing

it
was
purely
by

i
thought
had
i
explained

the

would
have
become

i
appreciate
your

let

know
thanks

given

it
up

you
could

come
up

of
combing
both
of
my
suggestions
into

short
snappy

people
will
click

does
this

marc

about

is
underdog

for
the

that
sounds
a

better
though
i
not
sure
if
underdog
triumphalism
needs
quotation
marks
it
quite
a
basic

cool
marc

an

so
far
based

starting

and
a
large
number

good

have
been

but
more

is

reach

there
may

to

for

there
is
an

given

i
glad
that
kevmin
available
to
review
the
second
article
though
it
would
have
been
possible
to
have
two
separate
reviewers
for
the
two
articles
if
he
had
been
as
for
the
use
of
a
monophyletic
group
i
agree
that
the
quotes
are
not
necessary
for
a
basic
scientific
term
but
i
not
sure
that
the
context
is
appropriate
the
article
seems
to
be
saying
that
although
dibaesis
baeomyces
is
related
to
the
baeomyces
after
all
it
is
related
to
these
other
two
species
being
in
a
monophyletic
group
with
them
but
the
source
says
that
baeomyces
is
in
that
same
monophyletic
group
with
baeomyces
and
gyalecta
ulmi
and
pertusaria
trachythallina
this
does
affect
the
hook
at
all
but
it
will
affect
the
article
assuming
i
have
misread
that
lichen
clade
iv
sentence
in
the
source
apologies
in
advance
if
i
have
bluemoonset
talk
october
through
the
conclusions
of
stenroos
depreist
i
agree
with
what
bluemoonset
notes
grammarfascist
it
looks
like
you
missread
the
genus
baeomyces
as
the
species
on
page
of
the
kev
min
october
am
more
than
willing
to
accept
that
i
may
have
misread
something
in
the
sources
i
used
i
like
science
but
i
am
not
a
scientist
by
training
that
said
in
reviewing
the
source
i
found
three
statements
i
had
used
to
build
the
article
two
are
unambiguous
i
think
our
data
suggest
that
baeomyces
rufus
and
dibaeis
baeomyces
syn
baeomyces
roseus
are
phylogenetically
distant
and
more
closely
related
to
taxa
from
other
orders
and
suborders
than
to
each
other
and
siphula
ceratites
and
thamnolia
vermicularis
form
a
monophyletic
assemblage
together
with
dibaeis
baeomyces
and
seem
to
support
what
in
the
article
i
created
then
there
is
pertusaria
trachythallina
of
the
lecanorales
forms
a
monophyletic
group
with
gyalecta
ulmi
of
the
gyalectales
baeomyces
and
dibaeis
baeomyces
of
the
leotiales
emphasis
added
the
inclusion
of
rufus
in
that
sentence
contradicts
the
rest
of
the
article
so
i
was
taking
it
as
a
misprint
shall
i
perhaps
add
a
quote
parameter
to
the
citation
to
clarify
where
the
information
is
coming
for
the
quotation
marks
i
will
take
them
out
thanks
for
reassuring
me
they
were
not
needed
kevmin
and
bluemoonset
i
also
struck
the
original
hook
since
it
only
applied
to
the
first
article

initial

new

long
enough
and
well
referenced
no
obvious
problems
with
it
and
the
hook
is
cited
and
checks
out
we
still
await
clarification
of
the
monophyly
paragraph
in
due
to
probable
missreading
of
the
source
as
identified
above
also
phylogentically
distant

need

kev
min
october
grammarfascist
i
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
you
on
the
one
sentence
being
out
of
place
given
the
consistency
of
the
article
on
the
unrelated
nature
of
the
two
species
i
would
clarify
in
the
article
that
there
is
some
confusion
on
the
nature
of
the
relation
and
see
if
there
is
any
new
papers
that
clarify
kev
min
october
kevmin
it
a
relief
to
read
that
you
do
think
i
misread
the
article
after
all
i
have
added
a
footnote
to
the
article
explaining
the
apparent
contradiction
in
the
stenroos
and
depriest
paper
i
also
found
and
added
a
third
study
that
also
established
baeomyces
and
dibaeis
as
distinct
genera
i
do
think
a
similar
note
is
necessary
in
as
that
article
only
asserts
that
was
found
not
to
belong
to
genus
baeomyces
and
says
nothing
further
about
the
relatedness
of
the
two
species
grammar

you
ought
to
omit

mention

no

with

i

would

is

october

thanks
for
reviewing
this
article
i
think
you
are
reviewing
it
or
do
you
just
have
comments
is
the
only
translation
given
as
being
related
to
the
name
of
this
pastry
by
a
source
i
think
trying
to
relate
it
to
similar
words
might
constitute
after
all
for
all
we
know
it
a
case
similar
to
fluke
in
english
which
can
have
a
meaning
similar
to
mishap
but
can
also
mean
a
sea
creature
fin
or
a
type
of
parasite
but
that
does
mean
every
use
of
the
word
is
intended
to
invoke
all
those
meanings
also
i
did
some
additional
googling
and
did
not
find
any
other
meaning
or
origin
given
for
the
word
because
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
filled
italian
pastries
two
others
cannoli
and
sfogliatelle
are
mentioned
in
the
article
of
which
pasticciotti
are
only
one
i
do
see
any
reason
not
to
put
crust
before
filling
olive
oil
is
used
though
from
the
research
i
did
just
butter
or
not
sure
i
understand
your
objection
to
composition
are
you
asking
for
a
synonym
or
do
you
think
crust
and
fillings
should
each
be
headers
without
an
umbrella
main
reason
i
did
choose
the
meat
image
even
with
that
being
the
primary
hook
was
that
i
did
think
the
image
would
be
intelligible
at
pixels
even
after
i
cropped

original

willing
to
be
convinced
though
had

make
it

have
more

expected

there

is
that

the
second
is
that

if

are
you
suggesting
we

maybe
they
have
the

you
say
is

otherwise
this
might
snowball
into
deleting
a
great

of

on

do
you
know
how
to

that

were

i
think
it
unlikely
that
incontrovertible
evidence
exists
and
common
person
view
may
be
required
if
you
are
sure
then
we
delete

strange
question
can
you
supply
a

to
the

as
i
never
seen
that
bit
but
being
as
this

was
placed
on

sold
for
dollars
then
i
would
guess
that
it
may
be
fairly
complete
what

there
is
a

of

apologies
if
some
of
my
statements
were
unclear
the
hook
is
fine
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
the
associated
line
of
text
in
the
article
itself
that
i
quoted
above
reads
awkwardly
and
should
probably
be
cleaned
up
a
i
know
no
one
likes
dealing
with
the
technical
details
of
image
licensing
the
issue
here
is
that
the
date
only
ensures
material
is
in
the
public
domain
if
it
was
published
prior
to
that
cutoff
not
merely
created
upon
further
review
the
underwood
underwood
image
is
fine
it
has

is
clearly
a

than

arthur

uploaded
the

if
there
information
available

is
all
in

there
as
i
done
what
i
can
to
fix
this
for
you
mostly
it
needed
a
notice
publication
for
artwork
is
sometimes
tricky
but
there
very
little
chance
of
this
being
other
than
in
the
public

to
be
a
stickler
for

everything
will

more

the
at

in

it

too
familiar

thus

have
little

the

we

it
to

so
i
ca
check
days
after
being

a
qpq
has
been
i
think
the
hook
itself
is
really
unclear
it
reads
awkwardly
because
of
the
structure
of
clauses
and
because
the
song
nor
the
remix
nor
the
band
is
mentioned
it
does
make
sense
to
someone
who
knows
nothing
about
the
subject
it
makes
it
difficult
to
engage
with
because
it
not
understandable
also
it
only
a
premiere
when
it
premieres
after
that
it
is
the

altered
is
the
wrong

have
sufficed
you

even

the

my
first
thoughts
were
that
this

was
a

contrived
to
combine

as
a
single
issue
but
the
cited
payvand

does
indeed
write
about
both
as
reasons
for

unless
someone
objects
to
the

imminently
it
looks
okay

me
new

i
suggest
the

but
i
think
this
is
quite
expanded
by
talk

think
you
are
confusing
the
concept
of

daring
one
can
bet

that
something

happen
but
one
can
not
bet

i
not
confusing
anything
when
money
is
involved
it
is
a

plus
it
is
sourced

a

not
a
dare
october
what
i
mean
is
that
the

does
make
sense
grammatically
one
can
not

you
can

that

it

too
october
it
was
a

i
do
really
care
what
it

all
i
trying

say
is

surely
it
would
be
the
other
way
round
i
added
an
to
reflect
that
edwardx

utc
edwardx
the
original
hook
refers
to
the
fact
that
from
outside
of
the

compound
you
can
only
see
the
roof
looming
above
the

so
you
can
determine
what

the

of
the

owner
by
observing
the
roof
shape
i
writing

this
much
understandable
is
even
better
i
think
you
could
cut
the

that

would
be
less
ambiguous
than
determined

the
problem
is
with

i
ca
find
a
citation
for
it
and
whether
it
correct
or
not
is
really
a
matter
of
interpreting
what
actually
cited
which
is
that
it
is
likely
that
it
bolstered
the
belief
that
according
to
jacob
field
the
operation
successfully
detained
twenty
five
divisions
in
defensive
positions
and
whether
directly
related

not

we
please
have

is
definitely
supported
by
a
reliable
source
moonraker
talk
october
for
the
review
is
this
not
sufficient
the
allies
considered
it
to
have
achieved
the
main
objectives
of
tying
down
german
forces
in
the
region
the
objective
of
zeppelin
was
to
do
exactly
that
tie
up
german
forces
in
the
area
yes
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
german
really
thought
that
an
invasion
would
happen
note
if
you
dig
into
this
topic
everyone
always
couches
analysis
with
caution
because
it
was
a
confused
time
and
the
operations
were
complex
but
they
were
cautious
enough
to
do
what
the
allies
wanted
anyway
i
always
try
to
find
interesting
hooks
that
intrigue
the
reader
i
could
pull
a
dry
fact
from
the
article
but
that
does
really
excite
me
errant

what
i
have
done
is
the
impact
section
to
make
clear
the
point
zeppelin
was
a
success
with
some
details
about
why
and
how
much
following
does
that
address
concerns
if
it
also
helps
a

zeppelin

errant

errant
i
do
sympathize
a
dry
fact
would
have
less
impact
but
a
dyk
hook
has
to
be
cited
a
hook
ca
be
an
inference
or
one
that
might
well
be
correct
if
you
were
saying
that
a
zeppelin
is
believed
to
have
tied
down
german
forces
in
the
balkans
that
would
be
fine
as
you
have
a
citation
for
it
but
i
could
find
one

comment
this

for

new
enough
long
enough
image
checks
out
the
problem
is
with
the
hook
which
says
founded
a
dynasty
of
irish
kings
however
the
main
body
of
the
article
says
that
the
werewolf
laignech
was
a
brother
of
kings
not
an
ancestor
now
i
see
the
ancestor
of
kings
is
in
the
cited
source
sconduto
but
that
does
seem
to
be
ancestor
in
the
strict
sense
would
you
be
able
to
explain
this
a
bit
more
to
me
here
but
possibly
also
in
the
article
st
anselm
talk
october
main
body
of
the
article
does
call
him
an
ancestor
he
was
said
to
be
the
brother
of
feradach
mac
duach
the
king
of
ossory
and
the
ancestor
of
its
subsequent
kings
who
ruled
until
being
deposed
by
the
normans
sconduto
and
also
john
carey
in
werewolves
in
ireland
medieval
celtic
winter
both
state
explicitly
that
laignech
was
ancestor
of
ossory
kings
thereafter
as
carey
puts
it
they
do
explain
how
this
came
about
so
i
not
expanded
on
it
further
as
it
would
be
original
research
on
my
part
but
the
most
likely
answer
is
that
laignech
kingly
brother
died
childless
and
the
throne
was
inherited
by
one
of
laignech
children
prioryman
talk
october
i
can
understand
not
wanting
to
or
but
for
dyk
we
really
need
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
i
see
the
text
here
it
does
seem
to
say
anything
about
kings
and
so
i
question
the
second
sentence
in
the
laignech
section
the
sconduto
source
has
a
footnote
for
the
ancestor
of
its
future
kings
sentence
but
it
does
seem
to
be
visible
on
google
books
st
anselm
talk
october
utc
not
from
the
but
from
another
work
ingantaib
specifically
the
manuscript
held
by
trinity
college
dublin
according
to
carey
i
made
the
attribution
clearer
in
the
article
prioryman
talk
october
utc
there
any
reason
the
carey
source
is
in
the
article
by
the
way
and
do
you
have
access
to
a
translation
of
ingantaib
i
like
to
know
what
it
actually
says
because
all
that
i
see
in
sconduto
is
that
ingantaib
talks
about
laignech
being
an
ancestor
of
a
line
of
werewolves
sounds
a
lot
like
the
brothers
elrond
and
elros
by
the
anyway
i
ca
help
feeling
sconduto
is
misreading
carey
st
anselm
talk
october
utc
misreading
is
mine
i
afraid
i
had
thought
carey
was
referring
to
ingantaib
but
on
a
second
reading
it
clear
that
he
is
referring
to
other
genealogies
the
exact
line
i
citing
is
on
page
and
reads
this
laignech
faelad
is
in
fact
a
figure
of
considerable
dynastic
importance
the
genealogies
portray
him
not
only
as
the
brother
of
feradach
mac
duach
a
king
of
ossory
who
died
in
or
but
as
ancestor
of
its
kings
thereafter
i
added
a
reference
to
this
in
the
article
the
genealogies
in
question
are
discussed
on

usefully
has
a

thank
you
i
think
we
getting
close
to
a
resolution
here
i
had
seen
that
genealogical
page
already
and
had
noted
that
it
does
mention
werewolves
but
it
seems
that
we
have
some
sources
saying
that
laignech
is
a
werewolf
and
some
sources
saying
that
he
is
an
ancestor
of
kings
however
we
do
seem
to
have
any
primary
source
that
conflates
the
too
it
is
something
that
carey
has
noticed
this
is
definitely
worth
including
in
the
article
and
in
the
dyk
hook
but
we
have
to
be
careful
of
wording
maybe
something
like
he
was
said
in
some
sources
to
be
the
ancestor
of
a
tribe
of
werewolves
and
in
others
to
be
an
ancestor
of
the
kings
of
ossory
what
do
you
think
st
anselm
talk
october
utc
not
sure
that
entirely
accurate
sconduto
writes
that
ingantaib
says
that
the
werewolves
were
descendants
of
laigne
ch
faelad
in
ossory
page
unfortunately
i
ca
find
a
translation
or
transcript
of
that
work
online
basically
we
have
three
facts
or
rather
claims
from
different
sources
that
laignech
faelad
was
the
brother
of
the
king
of
ossory
according
to
the
genealogies
that
he
was
a
werewolf
according
to
and
that
he
was
the
ancestor
of
the
werewolves
of
ossory
according
to
ingantaib
so
perhaps
a
viable
alternative
hook
might
be
something
like
the
following
prioryman
talk
october
utc
that
the
of
pictured
were
said
to
be
descended
from
a
werewolf
who
was
the
brother
of
an
irish
yes
i
would
be
happy
with
that

reviewed
by
giovanni
da
to
good
article
status
by

quite
like
to
save
this
for
halloween
as
part
of
a
set
with
a
new
hook
see
below
would
you
be
ok
with
this
i
see
if
i
can
find
an
appropriate
photo
to
go
with
it
prioryman
talk
october
that
an
audience
in
leipzig
was
the
first
to
hear
bach
heart
swims
in
idea
but
as
far
as
i
understand
we
have
to
be
factually
correct
we
do
know
about
the
first
audience
we
know
that
a
weimar
audience
heard
it
possibly
in
but
not
sure
could
be
could
have
been
the
first
but
we
do
know
only
then
a
leipzig
audience
please
rephrase
as
perhaps
using
also
a
monster
in
god
eyes
talk
october
how
about
the
following
then
with
the
image
on
the
right
prioryman
talk
october
that
bach
heart
swims
in
is
about
the
redemption
of
a
think
better
no
image
unless
you
have
one
of
a
swimming
heart
leave
room
for
imagination
do
we
have
to
mantion
that
a
monster
confessed
dramatically
heart
swims
in
talk
october
much
better
than
my
suggestion
nice
one
now
let
review
the
article
it
was
granted
ga
status
on
the
nomination
date
so
no
problem
there
clearly
long
enough
and
within
policy
with
a
good
assortment
of
reliable
sources
is
interesting
and
sourced
and
a
qpq
review
has
been
done
this
should
be
fine
to
run
now

edit

so
good

to
note
that
we
like

for

if
you
prefer
not

please
do

prioryman

no

to

had
already
suggested

check

no

content
is
fine
the
hook
is
okay
but
i
think
i
thought
of
one
that
is
more
interesting
and
would
fit
more
with
a
halloween
that
vampires
of
the

called
a

article
is
good
to
go
once
the
above
hook
is
to
what
i
have
october
the
hook
is
satisfactory
and
the
other
dyk
criteria
are
met
so
this
is
good
to
go
cwmhiraeth

a
note
to
say
that
we
looking
at
running

by

talk
at

source
for
the
largest
known
tail
to
body
size
ratio
says
one
of
the
largest
and
is
from
the
washington
post
not
a
scientific
publication
i
not
saying
it
is
true
but
you
need
better
sourcing
for
such
a
bold
claim
the
vampire
squirrel
is
also
a
bit
tabloidesque
it
hooky
but
does
really
rate
inclusion
in
the
same
sentence
as
the
observed
feeding
habits
i
be
back
later
i
going
to
rub
a
toad
on
my
lips
i
think
that
summons
a
prince
or
is
it
cures
warts
gives
you
warts
oh
great
belle
talk
september
added
an
extra
reference
for
the
tail
from
science
magazine
though
it
does
say
anything
different
to
the
wapo
it
also
refers
to
the
squirrel
as
a
vampire
i
would
hope
you
do
consider
science
to
be
a
tabloid
the
inclusion
of
the
alleged
vampirism
in
conjunction
with
the
observed
feeding
habits
is
a
deliberate
bit
of
debunking
as
virtually
all
of
the
recently
published
sources
about
the
squirrel
refer
to
vampirism
i
thought
it
would
be
important
to
state
up
front
exactly
what
is
known
about
its
feeding
habits
i
think
using
the
vampire
description
in
the
hook
is
eminently
justifiable
as
a
means
of
making
it
more
interesting
it
seems
to
have
made
you
look
so
it
evidently
works
but
be
careful
what
you
do
with
toads
can
also
get
high
on
prioryman
talk
september
actually
it
was
the
picture
that
hooked
me
not
the
threat
of
a
squirrel
making
me
its
vampire
bride
long
enough
new
enough
neutral
even
if
i
think
the
vampire
rumours
get
too
much
coverage
