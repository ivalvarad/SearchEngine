entered

in

A

in

mid-1990s
,
which
provides
vastly
larger
addressing
capabilities
and
more

VoIP
stands
for
referring
to
the
protocol
that
underlies
all
Internet
communication
.
The
idea
began
in
the
early
1990s
with
walkie-talkie
voice
applications
for
personal
computers
.
In
recent
years
many
VoIP
systems
have
become
as
easy
to
use
and
as
convenient
as
a
normal
telephone
.
The
benefit
is
that
,
as
the
Internet
carries
the
voice
traffic
,
VoIP
can
be
free
or
cost
much
less
than
a
traditional
telephone
call
,
especially
over
long
distances
and
especially
for
those
with
always-on
Internet
connections
such
as
cable
or
ADSL
VoIP
is
maturing
into
a
competitive
alternative
to
traditional
telephone
service
.
Interoperability
between
different
providers
has
improved
and
the
ability
to
call
or
receive
a
call
from
a
traditional
telephone
is
available
.
Simple
,
inexpensive
VoIP
network
adapters
are
available
that
eliminate
the
need
for
a
personal
quality
can
still
vary
from
call
to
call
,
but
is
often
equal
to
and
can
even
exceed
that
of
traditional
calls
.
Remaining
problems
for
VoIP
include
telephone
dialing
and
reliability
.
Currently
,
a
few
VoIP
providers
provide
an
emergency
service
,
but
it
is
not
universally
available
.
Older
traditional
phones
with
no
``
extra
features
''
may
be
line-powered
only
and
operate
during
a
power
failure
;
VoIP
can
never
do
so
without
a
power
for
the
phone
equipment
and
the
Internet
access
devices
.
VoIP
has
also
become
increasingly
popular
for
gaming
applications
,
as
a
form
of
communication
between
players
.
Popular
VoIP
clients
for
gaming
include
Ventrilo
and
Teamspeak

an
example
of

be

to

,

and
friends
as
an

.
It
can
be
uploaded
to
a

or
Transfer
-LRB-
FTP
-RRB-
server
for
easy
download
by
others
.
It
can
be
put
into
a
``
shared
location
''
or
onto
a
for
instant
use
by
colleagues
.
The
load
of
bulk
downloads
to
many
users
can
be
eased
by
the
use
of
mirror
servers
or
peer-to-peer
networks
.
In
any
of
these
cases
,
access
to
the
file
may
be
controlled
by
user
authentication
the
transit
of
the
file
over
the
Internet
may
be
obscured
by
encryption
and
money
may
change
hands
for
access
to
the
file
.
The
price
can
be
paid
by
the
remote
charging
of
funds
from
,
for
example
,
a
credit
card
whose
details
are
also
passed
--
usually
fully
encrypted
--
across
the
Internet
.
The
origin
and
authenticity
of
the
file
received
may
be
checked
by
or
by
MD5
or
other
message
digests
.
These
simple
features
of
the
Internet
,
over
a
worldwide
basis
,
are
changing
the
production
,
sale
,
and
distribution
of
anything
that
can
be
reduced
to
a
computer

for

.
This

Such

occurs
in

of
areas
including
scientific
research

software

may
do
this
with
or
without
i.e.

and
encryption
technologies
,
depending
on
the
requirements
.
This
is
encouraging
new
ways
of
working
from
home
,
collaboration
and
information
sharing
in
many
industries
.
An
accountant
sitting
at

can
audit

remote

,

on

all
over

Some
of
these
things
were
possible
before
the
widespread
use
of

,
but
the
cost
of

would
have
made
many
of
them
infeasible
in

Thus

traditionally

get

The

changes
the

To

civic

of

,
Berdal
also
notes
how
``
self-protective

''
are
put
in

threatened
by

China

attempts
to
filter
``

would
agree
that
this
resembles
a

measure
by

the

Nevertheless

both
types
represent
limitations
