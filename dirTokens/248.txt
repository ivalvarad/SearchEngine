the

therefore
does
not
concern
itself
with
in
any
detail
other
models
have
been
developed
such
as
the
that
attempt
to
be
comprehensive
in
every
aspect
of
communications
while
many
similarities
exist
between
the
models
they
are
not
compatible
in
the
details
of

indeed
protocols
are
usually
included
in
the
discussion
of

most
prominent
component
of
the
internet
model
is
the
internet
protocol
ip
which
provides
addressing

ip

internetworking
and
in
essence
establishes

itself
protocol
version
is
the
initial
version
used
on
the
first
generation
of
the
internet
and
is
still
in
dominant
use
it
was
designed
to
address
up
to
billion
internet
hosts
however
the
explosive
growth
of
the
internet
has
led
to
address
which
entered
its
final
stage
in
when
the
global
address
allocation
pool
was
exhausted
a
new
protocol
version
was
developed
in
the
which
provides
vastly
larger
addressing
capabilities
and
more
efficient
routing
of
internet
traffic
is
currently
in
growing
deployment
around
the
world
since
internet
address
registries
rirs
began
to
urge
all
resource
managers
to
plan
rapid
adoption
and
is
not
directly
interoperable
by
design
with
in
essence
it
establishes
a
parallel
version
of
the
internet
not
directly
accessible
with
software
this
means
software
upgrades
or
translator
facilities
are
necessary
for
networking
devices
that
need
to
communicate
on
both
networks
essentially
all
modern
computer
operating
systems
support
both
versions
of
the
internet
protocol
network
infrastructure
however
is
still
lagging
in
this
development
aside
from
the
complex
array
of
physical
connections
that
make
up
its
infrastructure
the
internet
is
facilitated
by
bi
or
commercial
contracts
and
by
technical
specifications
or
protocols
that
describe
how
to
exchange
data
over
the
network
indeed
the
internet
is
defined
by
its
interconnections
and
routing
services
internet
carries
many
most
prominently
such
as
apps
the
wide
online
and
wide
this
was
used
by
at
cern
and
became
the
world
first
people
use
the
terms
internet
and
wide
or
just
the
web
interchangeably
but
the
two
terms
are
not
synonymous
the
wide
is
the
primary
application
that
billions
of
people
use
on
the
internet
and
it
has
changed
their
lives
however
the
internet
provides
many
other
services
the
web
is
a
global
set
of
documents
images
and
other
resources
logically
interrelated
by
hyperlinks
and
referenced
with

these

vast
and
diverse
amount
of
online
information
compared
to

and
traditional

the
world
wide
web
has
enabled
the
decentralization
of
information
on
a
large

has
also
enabled
individuals

organizations
to
publish

to
a
potentially
large
audience
online
at
greatly
reduced
expense
and
time
delay
publishing
a
web

a

or
building
a

involves
little
initial
cost
and
many
services
are
available
however
publishing
and
maintaining
large
professional
web
sites
with
attractive
diverse
and
information
is
still
a
difficult
and
expensive
proposition
many
individuals
and
some
companies
and
groups
use
or
blogs
which
are
largely
used
as
easily
updatable
online
diaries
some
commercial
organizations
encourage
staff
to
communicate

in
their
areas
of

in
the
hope
that
visitors
will
be
impressed
by
the
expert

and
be
attracted
to
the

as
a
example
of
this
practice
is
microsoft

to
pique
the
public

providers
remain
popular
and
have
become
increasingly
sophisticated
whereas
operations
such
as
angelfire
and
geocities
have
existed
since
the
early
days
of
the
web
newer
offerings
from
for
example
facebook
and
twitter
currently
have
large
followings
these
operations
often
brand
themselves
as

over

the
process
of
creating
and
serving
web
pages
has
become
dynamic
creating
flexible
design
layout
and
content
websites
are
often
created
using
software
with
initially
very
little
content
contributors
to
these
systems
who
may
be
paid
staff
members
of
an
organization
or
the
public
fill
underlying
databases
with

using

designed
for
that
purpose
while
casual
visitors
view

there
may

systems
built
into
the
process
of

and
making
it
available

the
target
communication
email
is
an
important
communications
service
available
on
the
internet
the
concept
of
sending
electronic
text
messages
between
parties
in
a
way
analogous
to
mailing
letters
or
memos
predates
the
creation
of
the

pictures
documents
and
other
files
are
sent
as
emails
can
be
to
multiple
is
another
common
communications
service
made
possible
by
the
creation
of
the
internet
voip
stands
for
referring
to
the
protocol
that
underlies
all
internet
communication
the
idea
began
in
the
early
with
voice
applications
for
personal
computers
in
recent
years
many
voip
systems
have
become
as
easy
to
use
and
as
convenient
as
a
normal
telephone
the
benefit
is
that
as
the
internet
carries
the
voice
traffic
voip
can
be
free
or
cost
much
less
than
a
traditional
telephone
call
especially
over
long
distances
and
especially
for
those
with
internet
connections
such
as
cable
or
adsl
voip
is
maturing
into
a
competitive
alternative
to
traditional
telephone
service
interoperability
between
different
providers
has
improved
and
the
ability
to
call
or
receive
a
call
from
a
traditional
telephone
is
available
simple
inexpensive
voip
network
adapters
are
available
that
eliminate
the
need
for
a
personal
quality
can
still
vary
from
call
to
call
but
is
often
equal
to
and
can
even
exceed
that
of
traditional
calls
remaining
problems
for
voip
include
telephone
dialing
and
reliability
currently
a
few
voip
providers
provide
an
emergency
service
but
it
is
not
universally
available
older
traditional
phones
with
no
extra
features
may
be
only
and
operate
during
a
power
failure
voip
can
never
do
so
without
a
power
for
the
phone
equipment
and
the
internet
access
devices
voip
has
also
become
increasingly
popular
for
gaming
applications
as
a
form
of
communication
between
players
popular
voip
clients
for
gaming
include
ventrilo
and
teamspeak
modern
video
game
consoles
also
offer
voip
chat
is
an
example
of
transferring
large
amounts
of
data
across
the
internet
a
can
be
emailed
to
customers
colleagues
and
friends
as
an
attachment
it
can
be
uploaded
to
a
website
or
transfer
ftp
server
for
easy
download
by
others
it
can
be
put
into
a
shared
location
or
onto
a
for
instant
use
by
colleagues
the
load
of
bulk
downloads
to
many
users
can
be
eased
by
the
use
of
mirror
servers
or
networks
in
any
of
these
cases
access
to
the
file
may
be
controlled
by
user
authentication
the
transit
of
the
file
over
the
internet
may
be
obscured
by
encryption
and
money
may
change
hands
for
access
to
the
file
the
price
can
be
paid
by
the
remote
charging
of
funds
from
for
example
a
credit
card
whose
details
are
also
passed
usually
fully
encrypted
across
the
internet
the
origin
and
authenticity
of
the
file
received
may
be
checked
by
or
by
or
other
message
digests
these
simple
features
of
the
internet
over
a
worldwide
basis
are
changing
the
production
sale
and
distribution
of
anything
that
can
be
reduced
to
a
computer
file
for
transmission
this
includes
all
manner
of
print
publications
software
products
news
music
film
video
photography
graphics
and
the
other
arts
this
in
turn
has
caused
seismic
shifts
in
each
of
the
existing
industries
that
previously
controlled
the
production
and
distribution
of
these
is
the
delivery
of
digital
media
for
the
immediate
consumption
or
enjoyment
by
end
users
many
radio
and
television
broadcasters
provide
internet
feeds
of
their
live
audio
and
video
productions
they
may
also
allow
viewing
or
listening
such
as
preview
classic
clips
and
listen
again
features
these
providers
have
been
joined
by
a
range
of
pure
internet
broadcasters
who
never
had
licenses
this
means
that
an
device
such
as
a
computer
or
something
more
specific
can
be
used
to
access
media
in
much
the
same
way
as
was
previously
possible
only
with
a
television
or
radio
receiver
the
range
of
available
types
of
content
is
much
wider
from
specialized
technical
webcasts
to
popular
multimedia
services
podcasting
is
a
variation
on
this
theme
where
usually
audio
material
is
downloaded
and
played
back
on
a
computer
or
shifted
to
a
media
to
be
listened
to
on
the
move
these
techniques
using
simple
equipment
allow
anybody
with
little
censorship
or
licensing
control
to
broadcast
material
media
streaming
increases
the
demand
for
network
bandwidth
for
example
standard
image
quality
needs
link
speed
for
sd
hd
quality
requires
and
the
hdx
quality
needs
for
webcams
are
a
extension
of
this
phenomenon
while
some
webcams
can
give
video
the
picture
either
is
usually
small
or
updates
slowly
internet
users
can
watch
animals
around
an

at
a
local
roundabout
or
monitor
their

political
collaboration
is
also
becoming
more
widespread
as
both
internet
access
and

allows
computer
users
to
remotely

stores
easily
wherever
they
may
be
they
may
do
this
with

without

depending
on
the

this
is
encouraging
new

of
working
from

collaboration
and
information
sharing
in
many
industries
an
accountant
sitting
at

can
audit
the

have
been
created
by
bookkeepers
in
other
remote
locations
based
on
information
emailed
to
them
from

all
over
the
world
some
of
these
things
were
possible
before
the
widespread
use
of
the
internet
but
the
cost
of
private
would
have
made
many
of
them
infeasible
in
practice
an
office
worker
away
from
their
desk
perhaps
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
on
a
business

or
a

access
their

using
or
open
a

into

using

this
can
give
the

complete
access
to
all
of
their
normal

including

other

while

it
has
been
referred

by
businesses

other
organizations
to
promote
their

to

to
their

and
to
encourage

are
also

astroturfing
risk
for
both

organizations
writing
posts
especially
public

on
social

is
that
especially
foolish
or
controversial
posts
occasionally
lead
to
an
unexpected
and
possibly
backlash
on
social

from
other
internet
users
this
is
also
a
risk
in
relation
to
controversial
offline
behavior
if
it
is
widely
made
known
the
nature
of
this
backlash
can
range
widely
from

public
mockery
through
insults
and
to
in
extreme
cases

the

the

of
many

to

they

a
significant
number
of
feminist
women
have
been
the
target
of
various
forms
of
harassment
in
response
to

they
have
made
on

and
twitter
in

has
been
criticised
in
the
past
for
not
doing
enough
to
aid
victims
of

such
a
backlash
can
cause
overall
especially
if
reported
by
the

however
this
is
not
always
the
case
as
any
brand
damage
in
the
eyes
of
people
with
an
opposing
opinion
to
that
presented
by
the
organization
could
sometimes
be
outweighed
by
strengthening
the
brand
in
the
eyes
of
others
furthermore
if
an
organization
or
individual
gives
in
to
demands
that
others
perceive
as

then
provoke
a
websites
such
as
reddit
have
rules
forbidding
the
posting
of

individuals
also
known
as
doxxing
due
to
concerns
about
such
postings
leading
to
mobs
of
large
numbers
of

users
directing

at
the
specific
individuals
thereby
identified
in

the
reddit
rule
forbidding
the
posting
of

is
widely
understood
to
imply
that
all
identifying
photos

must
be
censored
in
facebook
screenshots
posted
to
reddit
however
the
interpretation
of
this
rule
in
relation
to
public
twitter
posts
is
less
clear
and
in
any
case
people
online
have
many
other
ways
they
can
use
to
direct
each
other
attention
to
public
social

posts
they
disagree
also
face
dangers
online

cyberbullying

by
sexual
who
sometimes
pose

children
may
also
encounter
material
which
they
may
find
upsetting
or
material
which
their
parents
consider
to
be
not
due
to
naivety
they
may
also
post
personal
information
about
themselves
online
which
could
put
them
or
their
families
at
risk
unless
warned
not
to
do
so
many
parents
choose
to
enable
supervise
their
children
online
activities
in
an
attempt
to
protect
their
children
from
inappropriate
material
on
the

the
most
popular
social

commonly
forbid

these
policies
are
typically
trivial

circumvent

of

the

of

was
notable
for
its
success
in
soliciting
donation
via
the

many
political
groups
use
the

to
achieve
a
new
method
of
organizing
for
carrying
out
their
mission
having
given
rise
to
most
notably
practiced
by

in
the

suggested
that
websites
such

helped

political
revolutions

by
helping
activists
organize
protests
communicate
grievances
and
disseminate
potential
of
the

as
a
civic
tool
of
communicative
power
was
explored
by
simon
berdal
in
his
the
globally
evolving
internet

ever
new
access
points
to
virtual
discourse
forums
it
also
promotes
new
civic
relations
and
associations
within
which
communicative
power
may
flow
and
accumulate
thus
traditionally
peripheries
get
entangled
into
greater
international
peripheries
with
stronger
combined
powers
the
internet
as
a
consequence
changes
the
topology
of
the
model
by
stimulating
conventional
peripheries
to
interlink
into
structures
which
enclose
and
besiege
several
centres
at
therefore
extends
the
habermasian
notion
of
the

the
internet
and
underlines
the
inherent
global
and
civic
nature
that
interwoven
internet
technologies
provide
to
limit
the
growing
civic
potential
of
the
internet
berdal
also
notes
how
measures
are
put
in
place
by
those
threatened
by
we
consider
china
attempts
to
filter
unsuitable
material
from
the
internet
most
of
us
would
agree
that
this
resembles
a
measure
by
the
system
against
the
growing
civic
potentials
of
the
internet
nevertheless
both
types
represent
limitations
to
peripheral
capacities
thus
the
chinese
government
tries
to
prevent
communicative
power
to
build
up
and
unleash
as
the
tiananmen
square
suggests
the
government
may
find
it
wise
to
install
upstream
measures
even
though
limited

is
proving
to
be
an
empowering
tool

philanthropy
spread
of

developing
countries
has
opened
up
new
possibilities
for
charities
which
allow
individuals
to
contribute
small

to
charitable
projects
for
other
individuals
websites
such

allow

to

of
their
popular
twist
on

the

kiva

kiva

microfinance
organizations

lenders

contribute
as
little
as
to

of
their
choice
and
receive
their
money
back
as

kiva
falls
short
of
being
a
pure
charity
in
that
loans
are
disbursed
before
being
funded
by
lenders
and
borrowers
do
not
communicate

to

across

without

members
can
fund

for
as
little
as
a

which
the

then
