Describing

described
Portal
's
2004
EP
,
as
``
extremely
raw

with
heavily
distorted
guitar
riffs
that
aid
in
the

overall
chaotic
and

-LSB-

-RSB-
The
band
's
style
has
also
been
described
as
oriented
around
``
constant
dissonance
''
,
``
sporadic
compositions
''
,
and
``
abstract

However
,
lead
guitarist
Horror
Illogium
has
disputed
the
view
that
the
band
's
songwriting
lacks
structure
:
``
We
are
indeed
making
songs
,
although
our
structures
are
unusual
.
They
are
constructed
with
a
great
deal
of
artistic
,
obsessive
scrutiny
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
An
insane
asylum
is
a
structure
;
our
songs
can
be
viewed
as
structures
housing
insane
-LSB-
8
-RSB-
if
Portal
's
exploration
of
extreme
music
could
eventually
move
beyond
the
scope
of
death
metal
,
Horror
Illogium
responded
explores
depth
and
atmosphere
in
the
aim
of
a
descriptive
soundscape
.
The
term
``
extreme
''
would
not
really
apply
to
us
in
the
context
that
other
bands
would
use
:
the
fastest
blastbeat
or
the
most
technical
guitar
work
.
That
kind
of
mindframe
as
though
it
is
a
sport
is
sickening
!
Extreme
for
the
sake
of
extreme
in
any
regard
has
no
place
in
our
art
.
The
feeling
must
flow
,
exploring
different
planes
of
darkness
and
atmosphere
.
There
is
no
interest
in
taking
the
main
core
of
Portal
beyond
Metal
at
all
.
In
fact
,
we
do
n't
feel
as
though
this
form
of
Death
Metal
has
reached
its
greatest
potential
-LSB-
8
-RSB-
some
critics
have
noted
a
``
lack
of
production
quality
''
and
``
unrefined
,
murky
sound
''
on
Portal
's
-LSB-
6
-RSB-
Horror
Illogium
countered
that
the
band
spends
considerable
time
consciously
``
exploring
different
equipment
for
guitar
tones
with
enough
articulation
as
well
as
-LSB-
8
-RSB-
Stating
that
``
there
are
only
so
many
frequencies
that
can
share
a
space
,
''
he
indicated
that
Portal
's
approach
involved
striking
``
a
balance
to
allow
the
instruments
to
spill
forth
and
explode
when
necessary
.
This
will
give
a
more
detailed
soundscape
and
accentuate

impact
and
depth
of

According

similarly
said
that

is
``
