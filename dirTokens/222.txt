an
australian

known
for
its
unorthodox
fusion
of
with
the
band
hybrid
musical
style
is
characterised
by
heavily
distorted
rhythms
and
vocals
ranging
from
menacing
echoing
to
writing

adrien

noted
that
death
metal
always
pretends
to
be
scary
but
it
all
rather
harmless
that
said
however
i
make
no
mistake
in
saying
that
the
death
metal
peddled
by
australia
portal
is
truly
friggin

the
band
has
been
praised
for
its
hellish
and
distant
interpretation
of
extreme
metal

writing
for

described
portal
ep
as
extremely
raw
with
heavily
distorted
guitar
riffs
that
aid
in
the
album
overall
chaotic
and
apocalyptic
the
band
style
has
also
been
described
as
oriented
around
constant
dissonance
sporadic
compositions
and
abstract
however
lead
guitarist
horror
illogium
has
disputed
the
view
that
the
band
songwriting
lacks
structure
we
are
indeed
making
songs
although
our
structures
are
unusual
they
are
constructed
with
a
great
deal
of
artistic
obsessive
scrutiny
an
insane
asylum
is
a
structure
our
songs
can
be
viewed
as
structures
housing
insane
if
portal
exploration
of
extreme
music
could
eventually
move
beyond
the
scope
of
death
metal
horror
illogium
responded
explores
depth
and
atmosphere
in
the
aim
of
a
descriptive
soundscape
the
term
extreme
would
not
really
apply
to
us
in
the
context
that
other
bands
would
use
the
fastest
blastbeat
or
the
most
technical
guitar
work
that
kind
of
mindframe
as
though
it
is
a
sport
is
sickening
extreme
for
the
sake
of
extreme
in
any
regard
has
no
place
in
our
art
the
feeling
must
flow
exploring
different
planes
of
darkness
and
atmosphere
there
is
no
interest
in
taking
the
main
core
of
portal
beyond
metal
at
all
in
fact
we
do
feel
as
though
this
form
of
death
metal
has
reached
its
greatest
potential
some
critics
have
noted
a
lack
of
production
quality
and
unrefined
murky
sound
on
portal
horror
illogium
countered
that
the
band
spends
considerable
time
consciously
exploring
different
equipment
for
guitar
tones
with
enough
articulation
as
well
as
stating
that
there
are
only
so
many
frequencies
that
can
share
a
space
he
indicated
that
portal
approach
involved
striking
a
balance
to
allow
the
instruments
to
spill
forth
and
explode
when
necessary
this
will
give
a
more
detailed
soundscape
and
accentuate
the
impact
and
depth
of
certain

his
idea
for
these

developed
by
the

and
horror

who
were

by

in
a

of

the

and
cthulhu

to
a
recent
interview
however
their
lore
is
deeply
set

guitarist
horror
illogium
stated
that
lovecraft
was
barely
more
than
a
mentioning
in
their
early
days
and
they
have
since
developed
their
own
mythos
the
curator
similarly
said
that
portal
is
not
a
lovecraftian
band
we
only
borrowed
from
the
mythos
in

infancy
