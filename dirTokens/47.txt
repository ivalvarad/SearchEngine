practically
equal

This
was
the
frequency
that
had
been
provisionally

It
was
soon
recognised
that
having
two
types
of
second
with
different
lengths
,
namely
the
UTC
second
and
the
SI
second
used
in
TAI
,
was
a
bad
idea
.
It
was
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
time
signals
to
maintain
a
consistent
frequency
,
and
that
that
frequency
should
match
the
SIsecond
.
Thus
it
would
be
necessary
to
rely
on
time
steps
alone
to
maintain
the
approximation
of

.

was
tried
experimentally

was
also
dissatisfaction
with
the
frequent
jumps
in
UTC
-LRB-
and
SAT
-RRB-
.
In
1968
,
the
inventor
of
the
caesium
atomic
clock
,
and
G.M.R.Winkler
both
independently
proposed
that
steps

be

-RSB-
This
system
was
eventually
approved
,
along
with
the
idea
of
maintaining
the
UTC
second
equal
to
the
TAI
second
.
At
the
end
of
1971
,
there
was
a
final
irregular
jump
of
exactly
0.107758
TAI
seconds
,
so
that
1
January
1972
00:00:00
UTC
was
1
January
1972
00:00:10
TAI
exactly
,
making
the
difference
between
UTC
and
TAI
an

.
At
the
same
time
,
the
tick
rate
of
UTC
was
changed
to
exactly
match
TAI
.
UTC
also
started
to
track
UT1
rather
than

and

observed
between

and

,
analysed
by
As
a
result
,
the
SIsecond
is
close
to
1/86400
of
a
mean
solar
day
in
the
mid‑19th
-LSB-
40
-RSB-
In
earlier
centuries
,
the
mean
solar
day
was
shorter
than
86,400
SI
seconds
,
and
in
more
recent
centuries
it
is
longer
than
86,400
seconds
.
Near
the
end
of
the
20th
century
,
the
length
of
the
mean
solar
day
-LRB-
also
known
simply
as
``
length
of
day
''
or
``
LOD
''
-RRB-
was
approximately
-LSB-
41
-RSB-
For
this
reason
,
UT
is
now
``
slower
''
than
TAI
by
the
difference
-LRB-
or
``
excess
''
LOD
-RRB-
of
excess
of
the
LOD
over
the
nominal
86,400
s
accumulates
over
time
,
causing
the
UTC
day
,
initially
synchronised
with
the
mean
sun
,
to
become
desynchronised
and
run
ahead
of
it
.
Near
the
end
of
the
20th
century
,
with
the
LOD
at
1.3
ms
above
the
nominal
value
,
UTC
ran
faster
than
UT
by
1.3
ms
per
day
,
getting
a
second
ahead
roughly
every
800
days
.
Thus
,
leap
seconds
were
inserted
at
approximately
this
interval
,
retarding
UTC
to
keep
it
synchronised
in
the
long
-LSB-
42
-RSB-
The
actual
varies
on
unpredictable
factors
such
as
and
has
to
be
observed
,
rather
than
as
adding
a
leap
day
every
four
years
does
not
mean
the
year
is
getting
longer
by
one
day
every
four
years
,
the
insertion
of
a
leap
second
every
800
days
does
not
indicate
that
the
mean
solar
day
is
getting
longer
by
a
second
every
800
days
.
It
will
take
approximately
50,000
years
for
a
mean
solar
day
to
lengthen
by
one
second
-LRB-
at
a
rate
of
2ms/cy
,
where
cy
means
century
-RRB-
.
This
rate
fluctuates
within
the
range
of
1.7
--
2.3
ms/cy
.
While
the
rate
due
to
alone
is
about
2.3
ms/cy
,
the
uplift
of
Canada
and
Scandinavia
by
several
metres
since
the
last
has
temporarily
reduced
this
to
1.7
ms/cy
over
the
last
-LSB-
43
-RSB-
The
correct
reason
for
leap
seconds
,
then
,
is
not
the
current
difference
between
actual
and
nominal
LOD
,
but
rather
the
accumulation
of
this
difference
over
a
period
of
time
:
Near
the
end
of
the
20thcentury
,
this
difference
was
about
1/800
of
a
second
per
day
;
therefore
,
after
about
800
days
,
it
accumulated
to
1second
-LRB-
and
a
leap
second
was
then
the
graph
of
DUT1
above
,
the
excess
of
LOD
above
the
nominal
86,400
s
corresponds
to
the
downward
slope
of
the
graph
between
vertical
segments
.
-LRB-
The
slope
became
shallower
in
the
2000s
,
because
of
a
slight
acceleration
of
Earth
's
crust
temporarily
shortening
the
day
.
-RRB-
Vertical
position
on
the
graph
corresponds
to
the
accumulation
of
this
difference
over
time
,
and
the
vertical
segments
correspond
to
leap
seconds
introduced
to
match
this
accumulated
difference
.
Leap
seconds
are
timed
to
keep
DUT1
within
the
vertical
range
depicted
by
this
graph
.
The
frequency
of
leap
seconds
therefore
corresponds
to
the
slope
of
the
diagonal
graph
segments
,
and
thus
to
the
excess
Future
also
:
the
Earth
's
rotation
continues
to
slow
,
positive
leap
seconds
are
required
more
frequently
.
The
long-term
of
of
LOD
is
approximately
+1.7
ms
per
century
.
At
the
end
of
the
21st
century
,
LOD
will
be
roughly
86,400.004
s
,
requiring
leap
seconds
every
250
days
.
Over
several
centuries
,
the
frequency
of
leap
seconds
will
become
time
in
the
22nd
century
,
two
leap
seconds
will
be
required
every
year
.
The
current
use
of
only
the
leap
second
opportunities
in
June
and
December
will
be
insufficient
,
and
the
March
and
September
options
will
have
to
be
used
.
In
the
25thcentury
,
four
leap
seconds
will
be
required
every
year
,
so
the
current
quarterly
options
will
be
insufficient
.
Thereafter
there
will
need
to
be
the
possibility
of
leap
seconds
at
the
end
of
any
month
.
In
about
two
thousand
years
,
even
that
will
be
insufficient
,
and
there
will
have
to
be
