chosen
to

that

the
royal
greenwich

and
the

national
physical
laboratory
coordinated
their

broadcasts
so
time
steps
and
frequency
changes
were
coordinated
and
the
resulting
time
scale
was
informally
referred
to
as
coordinated
universal
a
controversial
decision
the
frequency
of
the
signals
was
initially
set
to
match
the
rate
of
ut
but
then
kept
at
the
same
frequency
by
the
use
of
atomic
clocks
and
deliberately
allowed
to
drift
away
from
ut
when
the
divergence
grew

the

was

occurred

a
very
close

redefined
in
terms
of
the
frequency
supplied
by
a
caesium
atomic
clock
the
length
of

so
defined
was
practically
equal
to
the
second
of
ephemeris
this
was
the
frequency
that
had
been
provisionally
used
in
tai
since
it
was
soon
recognised
that
having
two
types
of
second
with
different
lengths
namely
the
utc
second
and
the
si
second
used
in
tai
was
a
bad
idea
it
was
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
time
signals
to
maintain
a
consistent
frequency
and
that
that
frequency
should
match
the
sisecond
thus
it
would
be
necessary
to
rely
on
time
steps
alone
to
maintain
the
approximation
of
ut
this
was
tried
experimentally
in
a
service
known
as
stepped
atomic
time
sat
which
ticked
at
the
same
rate
as
tai
and
used
jumps
of
to
stay
synchronised
with

also
dissatisfaction
with
the
frequent
jumps
in
utc
and
sat
in
the
inventor
of
the
caesium
atomic
clock
and
both
independently
proposed
that
steps
should
be
of
this
system
was
eventually
approved
along
with
the
idea
of
maintaining
the
utc
second
equal
to
the
tai
second
at
the
end
of
there
was
a
final
irregular
jump
of
exactly
tai

that
january
utc
was
january

exactly

the
difference
between
utc

the

changed

now
be

a

the

close
to
of
a

in

earlier

the
mean
solar

was
shorter

in

recent

it

longer

the

known
simply
as

approximately

this

with
the

above
the
nominal
value
utc
ran
faster
than
ut
by
ms
per
day
getting
a
second
ahead
roughly
every
days
thus
leap
seconds
were
inserted
at
approximately
this
interval
retarding
utc
to
keep
it
synchronised
in
the
long
the
actual
varies
on
unpredictable
factors
such
as
and
has
to
be
observed
rather
than
as
adding
a
leap
day
every
four
years
does
not
mean
the
year
is
getting
longer
by
one
day
every
four
years
the
insertion
of
a
leap
second
every
days
does
not
indicate
that
the
mean
solar
day
is
getting
longer
by
a
second
every
days
it
will
take
approximately
years
for
a
mean
solar

to
lengthen
by
one
second
at
a
rate
of
where

this
rate
fluctuates
within
the
range
of

the
rate
due

is
about
the
uplift
of
canada

scandinavia
by
several
metres
since
the
last
has
temporarily
reduced
this
to
over
the
last
the
correct
reason
for
leap
seconds
then
is
not
the
current
difference
between
actual
and
nominal
lod
but
rather
the
accumulation
of
this
difference
over
a
period
of
time
near
the
end
of
the
this
difference
was
about
of
a
second
per
day
therefore
after
about
days
it
accumulated
to
and
a
leap
second
was
then
the
graph
of
above
the
excess
of
lod
above
the
nominal
s
corresponds
to
the
downward
slope
of
the
graph
between
vertical
segments
the
slope
became
shallower
in
the
because
of
a
slight
acceleration
of
earth
crust
temporarily
shortening
the
day
vertical
position
on
the
graph
corresponds
to
the
accumulation
of
this
difference
over
time
and
the
vertical
segments
correspond
to
leap
seconds
introduced
to
match
this
accumulated
difference
leap
seconds
are
timed
to
keep
within
the
vertical
range
depicted
by
this
graph
the
frequency
of
leap
seconds
therefore
corresponds
to
the
slope
of
the
diagonal
graph
segments
and
thus
to
the

future
also
the

slow
positive
leap
seconds
are
required
more
frequently
the
of
of
lod
is
approximately
ms
per
century
at
the
end
of
the
century
lod
will
be
roughly
s
requiring
leap
seconds
every
days
over
several
centuries
the
frequency
of
leap
seconds
will
become
time
in
the
century
two
leap
seconds
will
be
required
every
year
the
current
use
of
only
the
leap
second
opportunities
in
june
and
december
will
be
insufficient
and
the
march
and
september
options
will
have
to
be
used
in
the
four
leap
seconds
will
be
required
every
year
so
the
current
quarterly
options
will
be
insufficient
thereafter
there
will
need
to
be
the
possibility
of
leap
seconds
at
the
end
of
any
month
in
about
two
thousand
years
even
that
will
be
insufficient
and
there
will
have
to
be
leap
seconds
that
are
not
at
the
end
of
a
in
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
years
the
timing
is
uncertain
lod
will
exceed
s
causing
utc
to
require
more
than
one
leap
second
per
is
a
proposal
to
redefine
utc
and
abolish
leap
seconds
such
that
sundials
would
slowly
get
further
out
of
sync
with
civil
the
resulting
gradual
shift
of
the
sun
movements
relative
to
civil
time
is
analogous
to
the
shift
of
seasons
relative
to
the
yearly
calendar
that
results
from
the
calendar
year
not
precisely
matching
the
length
this
would
be
a
major
practical
change
in
civil
timekeeping
but
would
take
effect
slowly
over
several
centuries
utc
and
tai
would
be
more
and
more
ahead
of
ut
it
would
coincide
with
local
mean
time
along
a
meridian
drifting
slowly
eastward
reaching
paris
and
thus
the
time
system
would
lose
its
fixed
connection
to
the
geographic
coordinates
based
on
the
the
difference
between
utc
and
ut
could
reach
hour
after
the
year
and
hours
around
study
and
working
were
unable
to
reach
consensus
on
whether
to
advance
the
proposal
to
the
radiocommunications
assembly
the
chairman
of
study
elected
to
advance
the
question
to
the
radiocommunications
assembly
january
but
consideration
of
the
proposal
was
postponed
by
the
itu
until
the
world
radio
conference
in
convening
on

rob
