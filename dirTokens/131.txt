summer

motivation

choose
not
to
migrate

the
longer
days
of
the
northern

helps
diurnal
birds
to
produce
larger
clutches
than
related
species
that
remain
in
the
tropics
as
the
days
shorten
in

the
birds
return
to
warmer

the
available
food
supply
varies

the
high

is
adopted
by
the
noctule

be
a

that
is

the

during

also
been

to
be

on
a
combination
of
other
abilities
including
the
ability
to
detect
magnetic
fields
magnetoception
use
visual
landmarks
as
well
as

migrants
are
believed
to
disperse
as
young
birds
and
form
attachments
to
potential
breeding
sites
and
to
favourite
wintering
sites
once
the
site
attachment
is
made
they
show

ability
of
birds
to
navigate
during
migrations
can
not
be
fully
explained
by
endogenous
programming
even
with
the
help
of
responses
to
environmental
cues
the
ability
to
successfully
perform
migrations
can
probably
only
be
fully
explained
with
an
accounting
for
the
cognitive
ability
of
the
birds
to
recognize
habitats
and
form
mental
maps
of
day
migrating
raptors
such
as
ospreys
and
honey
buzzards
has
shown
that
older
individuals
are
better
at
making
corrections
for
wind
birds
may
use
two
electromagnetic
tools
to
find
their
destinations
one
that
is
entirely
innate
and
another
that
relies
on
experience
a
young
bird
on
its
first
migration
flies
in
the
correct
direction
according
to
the
earth
but
does
not
know
how
far
the
journey
will
be
it
does
this
through
a
pair
whereby
chemical
reactions
in
special
sensitive
to
are
affected
by
the
field
although
this
only
works
during
daylight
hours
it
does
not
use
the
position
of
the
sun
in
any
way
at
this
stage
the
bird
is
in
the
position
of
a
with
a
compass
but
no
map
until
it
grows
accustomed
to
the
journey
and
can
put
its
other
capabilities
to
use
with
experience
it
learns
various
landmarks
and
this
mapping
is
done
by
magnetites
in
the
which
tell
the
bird
how
strong
the
field
is
because
birds
migrate
between
northern
and
southern
regions

different
latitudes

it
interpret
the
radical

mechanism
more
accurately

is
a
neural
connection
between
the
eye
and
cluster
n
the
part
of
the
forebrain
that
is
active
during

orientation
suggesting
that
birds
may
actually
be
able
to
see
the
magnetic
field
of
the
vagrancy
edit
birds
can
lose
their
way
and
appear
outside
their
normal
ranges
this
can
be
due
to
flying
past
their
destinations
as
in
the
spring
in
which
birds
returning
to
their
breeding
areas
overshoot
and
end
up
further
north
than
intended
certain
areas
because
of
their
location
have
become
famous
as
watchpoints
for
such
birds
examples
are
the
pelee
national
in
canada
and
spurn
in
england
where
the
genetic
programming
of
young
birds
fails
to
work
properly
can
lead
to
rarities
turning
up
as
vagrants
thousands
of
kilometres
out
of
of
birds
blown
off
course
by
the
wind
can
result
in
falls
of
large
numbers
of
migrants
at
coastal
related
phenomenon
called
abmigration
involves
birds
from
one
region
joining
similar
birds
from
a
different
breeding
region
in
the
common
winter
grounds
and
then
migrating
back
along
with
the
new
population
this
is
especially
common
in
some
waterfowl
which
shift

in

the
demands
of

the
storage
of
energy
through
the
accumulation
of
fat
and
the
control
of
sleep
in
nocturnal
migrants
require
special
physiological
adaptations
in
addition
the
feathers
of
a
bird
suffer
from
and
require
to
be
molted
the
timing
of
this
molt
usually
once
a
year
but
sometimes
twice
varies
with
some
species
molting
prior

moving
to
their
winter
grounds
and
others
molting
prior
to
returning
to
their
breeding
apart
from

as

is

to

independently
in
many
avian
while
it
is
agreed
that
the
behavioral
and
physiological
adaptations
necessary
for
migration
are
under
genetic
control
some
authors
have
argued
that
no
genetic
change
is
necessary
for
migratory
behavior
to
develop
in
a
sedentary
species
because
the
genetic
framework
for
migratory
behavior
exists
in
nearly
all
avian
this
explains
the
rapid
appearance
of
migratory
behavior
after
the
most
recent
glacial
analyses
show
that
detours
that
increase
flight
distance
by
up
to
will
often
be
adaptive
on
aerodynamic
grounds
a
bird
that
loads
itself
with
food
to
cross
a
long
barrier
flies
less
efficiently
however
some
species
show
circuitous
migratory
routes
that
reflect
historical
range
expansions
and
are
far
from
optimal
in
ecological
terms
an
example
is
the
migration
of
continental
populations
of
which
fly
far
east
across
before
turning
south
via
florida
to
reach
northern
this
route
is
believed
to
be
the
consequence
of
a
range
expansion
that
occurred
about
years
ago
