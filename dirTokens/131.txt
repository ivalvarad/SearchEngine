Migrating
waders
in
Western
is
the
regular
seasonal
movement
,
often
north
and
south
,
undertaken
by
many
species
of
birds
.
Bird
movements
include
those
made
in
response
to
changes
in
food
availability
,
habitat
,
or
weather
.
Sometimes
,
journeys
are
not
termed
``

because

bird
populations
migrate
long
distances
along
a
flyway
.
The
most
common
pattern
involves
flying
north
in
the
spring
to
breed
in
the
temperate
or
Arctic
summer
and
returning
in
the
autumn
to
wintering
grounds
in
warmer
regions
to
the
south
.
Of
course
,
in
the
southern

the

are

-RSB-
primary
motivation
for
migration
appears
to
be
food
;
for
example
,
some
hummingbirds
choose
not
to
migrate
if
fed
through
the

-RSB-
Also
,
the
longer
days
of
the
northern
summer
provide
extended
time
for
breeding
birds
to
feed
their
young
.
This
helps
diurnal
birds
to
produce
larger
clutches
than
related
non-migratory
species
that
remain
in
the
tropics
.
As
the
days
shorten
in
autumn
,
the
birds
return
to
warmer
regions
where
the
available
food
supply
varies
little
with
the
-LSB-
13
-RSB-
advantages
offset
the
high
stress
,
physical
exertion
costs
,
and
other
risks
of
the
migration
.
Predation
can
be
heightened
during
migration

islands
,

a
very
late
breeding
season
,
coordinated
with
the

passage
of

,
which
it
feeds

its
young

A
similar
strategy
is

The

a
species
not
all
populations
may
be
migratory
;
this
is
known
as
``

''
.
Partial
migration
is
very
common
in
the

continents
;

%
of
non-passerine

In
some
species
,
the
population
at
higher
latitudes
tends
to
be
migratory
and
will
often
winter
at
lower
latitude
.
The
migrating
birds
bypass
the
latitudes
where
other
populations
may
be
sedentary
,
where
suitable
wintering
habitats
may
already
be

migrations
begin
with
the
birds
starting
off
in
a
broad
front
.
Often
,
this
front
narrows
into
one
or
more
preferred
routes
termed
flyways
These
routes
typically
follow
mountain
ranges
or
coastlines
,
sometimes
rivers
,
and
may
take
advantage
of
updrafts
and
other
wind
patterns
or
avoid
geographical
barriers
such
as
large

The

Migration
routes
and
countries

illegal

activities
have
threatened
many
migratory
bird
species
.
The
distances
involved
in
bird
migration
mean
that
they
often
cross
political
boundaries
of
countries
and
conservation
measures
require
international
cooperation
.
Several
international
treaties
have
been
signed
to
protect
migratory
species
including
the
Bird
