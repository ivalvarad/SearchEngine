that
a
party
had
rebounded
from
third
place
in
the
commons
to
a
majority
government
cbc
news
offered
the
following
commentary
trudeau
astounding
success
also
highlights
the
reversals
of
fortune
for
both
the
conservatives
who
have
governed
since
and
the
ndp
who
were
first
in
the
polls
going
into
this
addition
to
the
appeal
of
his
party
platform
part
of
trudeau
success
has
been
credited
to
the
tories
negative
ads
backfiring
namely
that
negative
campaign
such
as
the
just
not
ready
campaign
was
judged
by
the
public
as
unfair
and
mocking
of
the
liberal
even
so
the
advertising
campaign
lowered
public
expectations
of
trudeau
performance
that
even
conservative
personnel
noted
that
he
would
impress
people
if
he
showed
any
display
of
competence
in
public
events
such
as
the
televised
that
proved
to
be
the
case
and
trudeau
took
advantage
of
his
opponents
underestimation
of
him
to
impress
the
public
with
his
articulate
and
passionate
manner
to
garner
support
throughout
the
campaign
until
his
party
won
the
majority
the
result
beyond
doubt
harper
announced
he
would
resign
all
his
leadership
posts
before
the
new
parliament
sits
though
retaining
his
seat

an

harper

he
no

has
enough
support

trudeau
will
next
advise
johnston
he
can
form

with
his
new
majority
after
which
johnston
is
expected
to
formally
