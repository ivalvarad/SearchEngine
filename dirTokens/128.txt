beaks
vary
significantly
in
size
and
shape
from
species
to
species
their
underlying
structures
have
a
similar
pattern
all
beaks
are
composed
of
two
jaws
generally
known
as
the
upper
mandible
or
maxilla
and
lower
mandible
or
the
upper
and
in
some
cases
the
lower
mandibles
are
strengthened
internally
by
a
complex
network
of
bony
spicules

trabeculae

a

upper

can
flex
upwards
because
it

supported
by
small
bones
which
can
move
slightly
backwards
and
upper
mandible
is
supported
by
a
bone
called
the
intermaxillary
the
upper
prong
of
this
bone
is
embedded
into
the
forehead
while
the
two
lower
prongs
attach
to
the
sides
of
the
skull
at
the

of
the
upper
mandible
a
thin
sheet
of
nasal
bones
is
attached

rhamphotheca
edit
outer
surface

can
be
subdivided
into
the
rhinotheca
of
the
upper
mandible
and
the
gnathotheca
of

this
covering
arises
from
the
malpighian
cells
of
the
bird
epidermis
growing
from
plates

compound
rhamphothecae
that
consist
of
several

studies
have
shown
that
this
was
the
primitive
ancestral
state
of
the

tomia
edit
the
sawtooth
serrations

help
it

tomia
singular
tomium
are
the
cutting
edges
of
the
two

most
birds
these
range
from
rounded
to
slightly
sharp
but
some
species
have
evolved
structural
modifications
which
allow
them
to
better
handle
their
typical
food
granivorous
birds
for
example
have
ridges
in
their
tomia

help
the
bird
to
slice

hull
most
falcons
have
a
sharp
projection
along
the
upper
mandible

a
corresponding
notch
on

lower
mandible
they
use
this
tooth
to
fatally
sever
their
prey
vertebrae
or
to
rip
insects
apart
some
kites
principally
those
that
prey
on
insects
or
lizards
also
have
one
or
more
of
these
sharp

do
the
shrikes
some
species
like
the
mergansers
have
sawtooth
serrations
along
their
tomia

help
them
to
keep

of
their
slippery

roughly
families
have
tomia
lined
with
tight
bunches
of
very
short
bristles
along
their
entire
length
most
of
these
species
are
either
insectivorous
preferring
prey
or
snail
eaters
and
the
projections
may
help
to
increase
the
of

the
mandibles

improving
the
bird

to
hold

hummingbird
bills

all
hummingbird
genera
may
perform
a
similar

they

commonly

this

generally

have
one

the

so
critical
to

the

more
than
a
dozen
types

are
responsible
for
the
coloration
of
most
red
orange
and
yellow
the
hue
of
the
color
is
determined
by
the
precise
mix
of
red
and
yellow
pigments
while
the
saturation
is
determined
by
the
density
of
the
deposited
pigments
for
example
bright
red
is
created
by
dense
deposits
of
mostly
red
pigments
while
dull
yellow
is

by
diffuse
deposits
of

bright

these

the
position
of
such

on

may
be
important
in
allowing

the

as
well
as
between

in

species
the
size

proportions
of
the
beak
vary
between

allows
the

of
the
larger
gull
species
have
bigger
stouter
beaks
than
those
of
females
of
the

species
and
immatures
can
have
smaller
more
slender
beaks
than
those
of
many

the
female
huia
slim

twice
as

as
the
male
straight

can
also
differ
between
sexes
or
ages

typically
such
a
color
difference
is
due
to
the
