The

of

a

beaks
vary
significantly
in
size
and

All

The

-LSB-
edit

A
gull
's
upper
mandible
can
flex
upwards
because
it
is
supported
by
small
bones
which
can
move
slightly
backwards
and
upper
mandible
is
supported
by
a
three-pronged
bone
called
the
intermaxillary
.
The
upper
prong
of
this
bone
is
embedded
into
the
forehead
,
while
the
two
lower
prongs
attach
to
the
sides
of
the
skull
At
the
base
of
the
upper
mandible
a
thin
sheet
of
nasal
bones
is
attached
to
the
skull
at
the
nasofrontal
hinge
,
which
gives
mobility
to
the
upper
mandible

is
a
region
found
near
the
tip
of
the
bill
in
several
types
of
birds
that
forage

by

The

consists
of

in

The
assumption

that
this
allows
the

to
perform
