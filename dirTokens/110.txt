at

in

there
has
been
an
ongoing
debate
pertaining
to
plans
to
relocate
trackage
off
the
streets
of
in
july
nictd
announced
its
intention
to
relocate
the
michigan
city
track
south
of
its
current
location
in
order
to
smooth
out
the
curves
cut
down
the
number
of
grade
crossings
increase
speed
and
reduce
maintenance
the
plan
also
calls
for
the
replacement
of
both
current
stations
with
a
single
new
station
it
would
be
located
a
block
west
of
the
current
street
boarding
location
between
franklin
and
washington
streets
with
a
modern
platform
and
a
large
parking
lot
the
plan
would
require
a
demolition
of
residential
and
retail
buildings
currently
located
on
the
south
side
of
relocation
effort
faced
a
setback
on
march

nictd
announced
that
it
did
not
have
the
funds
necessary
to
complete
the
preliminary
engineering
study
unless
the
funding
was
found
the
relocation
would
have
been
postponed
indefinitely
since
without
the
engineering
study
nictd
would
not
be
able
to
get
state
and
federal
funds
necessary
