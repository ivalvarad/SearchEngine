a

in
the

the

center
on
a
human
woman
,
Chell
forced
to
undergo
a
series
of
tests
within
the
Aperture
Science
Enrichment
Center
by
a
malicious
computer
,
GLaDOS
that
controls
the
facility
.
Each
test
involves
using
the
``
Aperture
Science
Handheld
Portal
Device
''
-
the
``
portal
gun
''
-
that
creates
a
human-sized
wormhole-like
connection
between
nearly
any
two
flat
surfaces
.
Not
only
can
the
player-character
or
objects
in
the
game
world
move
through
portals
,
their
momentum
is
conserved
.
This
allows
complex
``
flinging
''
maneuvers
to
be
used
to
cross
wide
gaps
or
perform
other
feats
to
reach
the
exit
for
each
test
chamber
.
A
number
of
other
mechanics
,
such
as
lasers
,
light
bridges
,
tractor
funnels
,
and
turrets
,
exist
to
aid

for
bringing
students

their
projects

The

was
introduced
by

the

received
near-universal
praise

and
have
sold
millions
of
copies
.
The
first
game
was
released
as
part
of
a
three-game
compilation
,
Orange
and
though
intended
as
a
short
bonus
feature
of
the
compilation
,
was
instead
considered
the
highlight
of
the
three

Its
success
led
to
the
creation
of
the
much
longer
which
included
both
single
player
and
cooperative
player
modes
;
it
too
received
mostly
positive
critical
reviews

In

the
challenging

place
in
the
fictional
``
Aperture
Science
Enrichment
Center
''
.
Aperture
Science
was
founded
by
-LRB-
voiced
by
and
originally
sought
to
make
shower
curtains
for
the
military
.
Its
research
happened
upon
the
discovery
of
portal
technology
,
and
soon
became
a
direct
competitor
with
Mesa
Research
-LRB-
from
the
Half-Life
series
-RRB-
for
government
funding
.
Johnson
acquired
the
rights
to
a
disused
salt
mine
in
the
Upper
Peninsula
of
Michigan
,
where
they
started
building
a
labyrinth
set
of
offices
,
laboratories
,
facilities
,
and
test
chambers
.
During
this
time
,
Johnson
became
poisoned
from
exposure
to
moon
dust
,
a
key
component
of
the
paint
needed
for
the
portal
technology
,
and
became
increasingly
the
player
explores
these
long-abandoned
areas
of
Aperture
,
learning
that
the
company
had
moved
from
testing
on
the
country
's
finest
,
to
paid
volunteers
,
and
ultimately
to
forcing
its
own
employees
to
participate
in
testing
.
Near
the
point
of
his
death
,
Johnson
ordered
his
lifelong
assistant
Caroline
-LRB-
voiced
by
to
be
the
first
test
subject
for
a
mind-to-computer
transfer
;
her
personality
would
ultimately
form
the
core
of
GLaDOS
-LRB-
also
McLain
-RRB-
.
Sometime
after
Johnson
's
death
,
the
old
sections
of
the
facility
were
vitrified
,
and
a
more
modern
facility
built
atop
those
ruins
.
GLaDOS
was
built
to
control
the
facility
and
monitor
the
tests
,
but
researchers
found
that
the
computer
had
villainous
tendencies
,
threatening
to
kill
the
entire
staff
before
it
was
shut
down
in
time
.
The
Aperture
researches
constructed
a
number
of
``
personality
cores
''
that
would
fit
onto
GLaDOS
to
prevent
her
from
turning
against
them
.
Despite
this
,
on
the
day
she
was
officially
activated
-LRB-
coincidentally
on
Your
Daughter
to
Work
she
turned
against
the
researchers
and
killed
nearly
everyone
in
the
facility
with
lethal
doses
of
neurotoxin
gas
.
In
the
games
and
the
comic
one
employee
Doug
Rattmann
survived
due
to
his
schizophrenia
and
distrust
of
GLaDOS
.
In
trying
to
find
a
way
to
defeat
GLaDOS
,
he
finds
that
Chell
one
of
the
human
subjects
kept
in
cryogenic
storage
within
Aperture
,
has
a
high
level
of
tenacity
,
and
arranges
for
the
events
of

to
occur
by
moving
her
to

numerous

of

the

has
fallen
into
disrepair
without

A
personality

named
Wheatley
wakes
Chell
from

sleep
to
help
her
stop
a
reactor
failure
,
but
inadvertently
awaken
GLaDOS

who
had
redundantly

personality

Though
they
defeat

by
putting
Wheatley
in

place
,
Wheatley
is
overwhelmed
with
power
,
sending
Chell
and

computer

to

where

rediscovers

They
return

Wheatley
before

to

GLaDOS
is
returned
to

GLaDOS
then
lets

go
,
realizing
that
the
prospect
of
trying

her
is
too
much
trouble

Instead

On

placed
portals
on
the

by

generally
divided
into
a
series
of
test
chambers
;
other
sections
of
the
game
are
more
exploratory
areas
that
connect
these
chambers
.
Each
chamber
has
an
exit
door
that
must
be
reached
,
often
requiring
that
certain
conditions
have
been
met
such
as
having
weighed
down
a
large
button
with
a
``
Weighted
Cube
''
,
effectively
a
crate
.
These
puzzles
require
the
use
of
the
Aperture
Science
Handheld
Portal
Device
,
the
portal
gun
.
The
gun
can
shoot
two
portals
,
colored
differently
for
identification
,
on
any
flat
surface
that
can
accept
a
portal
.
Once
both
portal
ends
are
placed
,
the
player
can
walk
the
character
between
them
,
or
carry
objects
with
the
portal
gun
through
them
.
Portal
ends
can
be
re
positioned
as
often
as
necessary
,
but
certain
actions

such
as
walking
through
``
emancipation
grills
''
or
moving
a
surface
with
a
portal
will
cause
the
portals
to
critical
feature
of
portals
is
that
they
retain
the
magnitude
of
momentum
when
an
object
travels
through
it
;
as
stated
by
GLaDOS
to
the
player
in
the
first
game
,
``
Speedy
thing
goes
in
,
speedy
thing
comes
out
''
.
When
portals
are
placed
on
non-parallel
planes
,
this
can
create
the
effect
of
``
flinging
''
.
Commonly
,
one
uses
gravity
to
build
up
their
momentum
when
they
fall
into
a
portal
,
which
flings
them
out
of
the
other
side
to
gain
speed
and
distance
that
normal
jumping
and
running
could
not
generate
.
A
leapfrogging
effect
can
be
used
by
placing
portals
in

during
this
flinging
,
gaining
further
momentum
with
each

also
allow
light
and
other
objects
to

and
numerous
puzzles

portals
to

This
``
Space
Core
''
has
become
its
own
meme
,
and
furthering
it
,
Valve
prepared
a
special
bit
of
downloadable
content
for
the
game
Elder
Scrolls
V
:
where
the
player
can
find
and
collect
the
Space
Core
in
their
inventory
.
The
Space
Core
's
name
itself
is
a
pun
on
the
term
`
space
corps
'
,
and
might
also
be
interpreted
as
`
astronaut
