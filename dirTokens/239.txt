any
two
flat
surfaces
not
only
can
the

objects
in
the
game
world
move
through
portals
their
momentum
is
conserved
this
allows
complex
flinging
maneuvers
to
be
used
to
cross
wide
gaps
or
perform
other
feats
to
reach
the
exit
for
each
test
chamber
a
number
of

such
as
lasers
light

tractor
funnels
and

a

glados
was
built
to
control
the
facility
and
monitor
the
tests
but
researchers
found
that
the
computer
had
villainous
tendencies
threatening
to
kill
the
entire
staff
before
it
was
shut
down
in

the
aperture
researches
constructed
a
number
of
personality
cores
that
would
fit
onto
glados
to
prevent
her
from
turning
against

despite
this
on
the
day
she
was
officially
activated
coincidentally
on
your
daughter
to

she
turned
against

killed
nearly
everyone

manipulating

lucrative

valve

approached
cryptozoic

found
application
in
educational
aspects
outside

the
first

was
praised
as
an
example
of
where
the
student
is
first
given
an
environment
to
learn
new
tools
with
sufficient
but
these
facets
are
slowly
removed
as
the

at
least
one
college
introduced

newell

intention
to
direct

and
towards

newell
stated
that
valve
does
see
divide
between
making
a
game
that
can
do
well
and
be
educational
and
was
already
working
with
schools
to
develop

plans
around

the

festival
newell

the

in
a
teach

program

newell
announced
at

make
it
suitable
for

plans
as
well
as
making
it
as
easy
for

to
use

the
