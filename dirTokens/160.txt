arts
center
for
the
performing
is
a
vast
subdivision
of
culture
composed
of
many
creative
endeavors
and
disciplines
it
is
a
broader
term
than
art
which
as
a
description
of
a
field
usually
means
only
the
encompass
the
the
and
the
music
theatre
dance
and
film
among
others
this
list
is
by
no
means
comprehensive
but
only
meant
to
introduce
the
concept
of
the
arts
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
history
of
the
arts
begins
with
the
of
the
arts
might
have
origins
in
early
human
evolutionary
greek
art
saw
the
veneration
of
the
animal
form
and
the
development
of
equivalent
skills
to
show
musculature
poise
beauty
and
anatomically
correct
proportions
art
depicted
gods
as
idealized
humans
shown
with
characteristic
distinguishing
features
jupiter
thunderbolt
in
byzantine
and
of
the
the
dominance
of
the
church
insisted
on
the
expression
of
biblical
and
not
material
truths
eastern
art
has
generally
worked
in
a
style
akin
to
western
medieval
art
namely
a
concentration
on
surface
patterning
and
local
colour
meaning
the
plain
colour
of
an
object
such
as
basic
red
for
a
red
robe
rather
than
the
modulations
of
that
colour
brought
about
by
light
shade
and
reflection
a
characteristic
of
this
style
is
that
the
local
colour
is
often
defined
by
an
outline
a
contemporary
equivalent
is
the
cartoon
this
is
evident
in
for
example
the
art
of
india
tibet
and
japan
religious
islamic
art
forbids
iconography
and
expresses
religious
ideas
through
geometry
instead
the
physical
and
rational
certainties
depicted
by
the
enlightenment
were
shattered
not
only
by
new
discoveries
of
relativity
by
einstein
and
of
unseen
psychology
by
freud
but
also
by
unprecedented
technological
development
paradoxically
the
expressions
of
new
technologies
were
greatly
influenced
by
the
ancient
tribal
arts
of
africa
and
oceania
through
the
works
of
paul
gauguin
and
the
pablo
picasso
and
the
cubists
as
well
as
the
