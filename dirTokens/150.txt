a
Canadian
metallurgist
research
physicist
author
and
educator
who
has
taught
at
the
of
for
more
than
40
years
.
She
is
the
author
of
Real

of

is
based
on
her
1989
and
Ursula

Reader
:

a
a
collection
of
her
papers
,
interviews
,
and
talks
.
Franklin
is
a
practising
Quaker
and
has
been
active
in
working
on
behalf
of
pacifist
and
feminist
causes
.
Franklin
has
received
numerous
honours
and
awards
,
including
the
General
's
Award
in
Commemoration
of
the
Persons
for
promoting
the
equality
of
girls
and
women
in
Canada
and
the
Medal
of
for
her
work
in
advancing
human
rights
.
Franklin
is
best
known
for
her
writings
on
the
political
and
social
effects
of
technology
.
For
her
,
technology
is
a
comprehensive
system
that
includes
methods
,
procedures
,
organization
,
``
and
most
of
all
,
a
mindset
''
.
She
distinguishes
between
holistic
technologies
used
by
craft
workers
or
artisans
and
prescriptive
ones
associated
with
a
division
of
labour
in
large-scale
production
.
Franklin
argues
that
the
dominance
of
prescriptive
technologies
in
modern
society
discourages
critical
thinking
and
promotes
``
a
culture
of
compliance
''
.
