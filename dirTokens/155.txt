History
is
the
discovery
,
collection
,
organization
,
analysis
and
presentation
of
information
about
past
events
.
History
can
also
mean
a
continuous
,
typically
chronological
,
record
of
important
or
public
events
or
of
a
particular
trend
or
institution
.
Scholars
who
write
about
history
are
called
historians
It
is
a
field
of
knowledge
which
uses
a
narrative
to
examine
and
analyse
the
sequence
of
events
,
and
it
sometimes
attempts
to
investigate
objectively
the
patterns
of
cause
and
effect
that
determine
events
.
Historians
debate
the
nature
of
history
and
its
usefulness
.
This
includes
discussing
the
study
of
the
discipline
as
an
end
in
itself
and
as
a
way
of
providing
``
perspective
''
on
the
problems
of
the
present
.

stories

to
a
particular
culture

but
not
supported

sources

usually
classified
as
rather
than

and
,
along
with
his
contemporary
Thucydides
forms
the
foundations
for
the
modern
study
of
history
.
Their
influence
,
along
with
other
historical
traditions
in
other
parts
of
their
world
,
have
spawned
many
different
interpretations
of
the
nature
of
history
which
has
evolved
over
the
centuries
and
are
continuing
to
change
.
The
modern
study
of
history
has
many
different
fields
including
those
that
focus
on
certain
regions
and
those
which
focus
on
certain
topical
or
thematic
elements
of
historical
investigation

Often
history
is
taught
as
