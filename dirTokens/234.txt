consider
a
computer
game
environment
which
may

many
polygons
only
a
few
of
which
may
be
visible
on

at
a

by
determining
which
polygons
are
currently
not

portal
system
is
based
on
using
the
partitioning
of
space
to
form
generalizations
about
the
visibility
of
objects
within
those
spaces
regions
of
map
space
are
divided
into
polygonal
generally
convex
areas
called
zones
or
sometimes
sectors
adjacent
zones
are
linked
to
one
another
via
shared
dividing
polygons
termed
portals
approaches
that
precompute
visibility
for
zones
are
referred
to
as
visible
or
pvs
example
in
a
such
as
descent
the
game
area
might
be
divided
into
several
zones
these
zones
would
then
be
connected
to
each
other
by
small
openings
such
as
doors
or
windows
these
openings
are
referred
to
as
portals
when
the
zone
behind
a
portal
needs
to
be
drawn
the
only
parts
that
are
visible
are
the
parts
that
can
be
seen
through
the
portal
therefore
the
zone
can
be
clipped
against
the
portal
boundaries
to
remove
use
of
portals
simplifies
the
task
of
determining
visible
areas
and
objects
from
any
given
point
of
view
of
the
level
and
simplifies
rendering
by
allowing
it
to
use
each
portal
as
a
for
the
area
it
leads
to
ideally
portals
are
formed
of
confined
areas
like
doors
or
tunnels
connecting
two
complex
areas
of
the

each
of
these
