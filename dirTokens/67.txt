When
Greenwich
was
an
active
observatory
,
geographical
coordinates
were
referred
to
a
local
called
a
known
as
a
whose
surface
closely
matched
local
mean
sea
level
.
Several
datums
were
in
use
around

all
using
different
spheroids
,
because
mean
sea
level
undulates
by
as
much
as
100
metres
worldwide
.
Modern
geodetic
reference
systems
,
such
as
the
Geodetic
and
the
Terrestrial
Reference
use
a
single
oblate
spheroid
,
fixed
to
the
Earth
's
gravitational
centre
.
The
shift
from
several
spheroids
to
one
worldwide
spheroid
caused
all
geographical
coordinates
to
shift
by
many
metres
,
sometimes
as
much
as
several
hundred
metres
.
The
Prime
Meridian
of
these
modern
reference
systems
is
102.5
