portal
is
a
system
of
in
the
brain
that
connects
the
hypothalamus
with
the
its
main
function
is
the
transport
and
exchange
of
hormones
to
allow
a
fast
communication
between
both
glands
the
fenestrated
structure
of
capillaries
in
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
facilitates
a
rapid
exchange
between
the
hypothalamus
and
the
pituitary
with
only
a
small
amount
of
hormones
needed
to
stimulate
an
accurate
effect
in
the
respective
target
organs
in
the
released

the
from
hypothalamic
nuclei

transported
to
the
anterior
pituitary
where
they
apply
their
effects
branches
from
the
internal
carotid
artery
provide
the
blood
supply
to
the
pituitary
the
hypophyseal
form
the
primary
capillary
plexus
that
supplies
blood
to
the
median
eminence
from
this
capillary
system
the
blood
is
drained
in
hypophyseal
portal
veins
into
the
secondary
plexus
the
peptides
released
at
the
median
eminence
enter
the
primary
plexus
capillaries
from
there
they
are
transported
to
the
anterior
pituitary
via
hypophyseal
portal
veins
to
the
secondary
plexus
the
secondary
plexus
is
a
network
of
fenestrated
sinusoid
capillaries
that
provide
blood
to
the
anterior
pituitary
the
cells
of
the
anterior
pituitary
express
specific
that
bind
to
the
neuropeptides
activating
intracellular
cascades
that

blood
supply
and
direction
of
flow
in
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
has
been
studied
over
several
years
on
human
cadaver
specimens
with
injection
methods
results
of
these
studies
have
shown
that
the
neural
hypophyseal
stalk
receives
arterial
blood
from
ascending
and
descending
infundibular
branches
coming
from
the
arteries
of
the
superior
hypophyseal
arterial
system
small
ascending
vessels
arising
from
the
anastomoses
that
connect
the
upper
with
the
lower
hypophyseal
arterial
system
also
supply
blood
to
hypophyseal
vessels
the
majority
of
these
branches
penetrate
into
the
neural
tissue
to
break
up
into
capillaries

hormone
secretion
in
the
developing
fetus
is
crucial
for
its
growth
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
in
order
to
allow
a
controlled
hormone
secretion
in
the
developing
organs
of
the
fetus
stimulating
hormones
must
be
exchanged

the
regulating
structures

early
stages
of

blood
vessels
between
the
hypothalamus
and
the
pituitary
gland
similar
to
those
of
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
can
be
observed
in
early
developmental
stages
of
the
fetus
a
study
performed
on
ovine
fetuses
about
days
of
gestation
showed
extensive
and
very
capillary
connections
between
the
median
eminence
the
pituitary
stalk
and
the
pituitary
gland
in
some
of
the
fetuses
portal
capillary
loops
had
penetrated
into
the
median
eminence
these
findings
suggest
that
in
the
ovine
fetus
hypothalamic
releasing
hormones
can
be
transported
directly
via
a
portal
vascular
way
to
the
pituitary
gland
that
develops
as
early
as
days
of
gestation
these
experimental
results
give
evidence
for
an
early
development

developed
hypophysial
portal
system

as

as
insufficiencies

can
cause
a
negative
effect
on
the
ability
of
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
to
exchange
hormones
between
both

this

have
major
effects
on
the

properly
occlusions

other
issues
