portal
is
a
system
of
in
the
brain
that
connects
the
hypothalamus
with
the
Its
main
function
is
the
transport
and
exchange
of
hormones
to
allow
a
fast
communication
between
both
glands
.
The
fenestrated
structure
of
capillaries
in
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
facilitates
a
rapid
exchange
between
the
hypothalamus
and
the
pituitary
,
with
only
a
small
amount
of
hormones
needed
to
stimulate
an
accurate
effect
in
the
respective
target
organs
in
the
released

the
from
hypothalamic
nuclei
are
transported
to
the
anterior
pituitary
,
where
they
apply
their
effects
.
Branches
from
the
internal
carotid
artery
provide
the
blood
supply
to
the
pituitary
.
The
hypophyseal
form
the
primary
capillary
plexus
that
supplies
blood
to
the
median
eminence
.
From
this
capillary
system
,
the
blood
is
drained
in
hypophyseal
portal
veins
into
the
secondary
plexus
.
The
peptides
released
at
the
median
eminence
enter
the
primary
plexus
capillaries
.
From
there
,
they
are
transported
to
the
anterior
pituitary
via
hypophyseal
portal
veins
to
the
secondary
plexus
.
The
secondary
plexus
is
a
network
of
fenestrated
sinusoid
capillaries
that
provide
blood
to
the
anterior
pituitary
.
The
cells
of
the
anterior
pituitary
express
specific
protein-coupled
that
bind
to
the
neuropeptides
,
activating
intracellular
cascades
that
produce
the
release
of
anterior
pituitary

blood
supply
and
direction
of
flow
in
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
has
been
studied
over
several
years
on
human
cadaver
specimens
with
injection
methods
.
Results
of
these
studies
have
shown
that
the
neural
hypophyseal
stalk
receives
arterial
blood
from
ascending
and
descending
infundibular
branches
,
coming
from
the
arteries
of
the
superior
hypophyseal
arterial
system
.
Small
ascending
vessels
arising
from
the
anastomoses
that
connect
the
upper
with
the
lower
hypophyseal
arterial
system
also
supply
blood
to
hypophyseal
vessels
.
The
majority
of
these
branches
penetrate
into
the
neural
tissue
to
break
up
into
capillaries
for
rapid
hormone

hormone
secretion
in
the
developing
fetus
is
crucial
for
its
growth
in
the
womb
of
the
mother
.
In
order
to
allow
a
controlled
hormone
secretion
in
the
developing
organs
of
the
fetus
,
stimulating
hormones
must
be
exchanged
in
the
regulating
structures
in
the
brain
in
early
stages
of
the
development
.
Hormone-exchanging
blood
vessels
between
the
hypothalamus
and
the
pituitary
gland
,
similar
to
those
of
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
,
can
be
observed
in
early
developmental
stages
of
the
fetus
.
A
study
performed
on
ovine
fetuses
,
about
48-67
days
of
gestation
,
showed
extensive
and
very
well-developed
capillary
connections
between
the
median
eminence
,
the
pituitary
stalk
,
and
the
pituitary
gland
.
In
some
of
the
fetuses
,
portal
capillary
loops
had
penetrated
into
the
median
eminence
.
These
findings
suggest
that
,
in
the
ovine
fetus
,
hypothalamic
releasing
hormones
can
be
transported
directly
via
a
portal
vascular
way
to
the
pituitary
gland
that
develops
as
early
as
45
days
of
gestation
.
These
experimental
results
give
evidence
for
an
early
development
of
what
is
later
the
fully
developed
hypophysial
portal
system
.

or
under-function
as
well
as
insufficiencies
of
the
hypothalamus
or
the
pituitary
gland
can
cause
a
negative
effect
on
the
ability
of
the
hypophyseal
portal
system
to
exchange
hormones
between
both
structures
rapidly
.
This
can
have
major
effects
on
the
respective
target
glands
,
making
it
impossible
for
them
to
carry
out
their
functions
properly
.
Occlusions
and
other
issues
in
the
blood
vessels
of
the
hypophysial
portal
system
can
also
cause
complications
in
the
exchange
of
hormones
between
the
hypothalamus
and
the
pituitary
