the
hepatic
portal
vein
and
its
microscopic
section
through
a
small
portal
vein
branch
inside
the
liver
the
portal
is
the
system
of
veins
comprising
the
portal
and
its
tributaries
it
is
also
called
the
venous
although
it
is
not
the
only
example
of
a
venous
and
which
is
not
synonymous
with
portal
and
is
imprecise
as
it
means
visceral

venous
is
responsible
for
directing
blood
from
parts
of
the
to
the
liver
substances
absorbed
in
the
small
intestine
travel
first
to
the
liver
for
processing
before
continuing
to
the
heart
not
all
of
the
is
part
of
this
system
the
system
extends
from
about
the
lower
portion
of
the
esophagus
to
the
upper
part
of
the
it
also
includes
venous
drainage
from
the
spleen
and
pancreas
drugs
that
are
absorbed
through
the
are
substantially
metabolized
by
the
liver
before
reaching
general
circulation
this
is
known
as
the
pass
as
a
consequence
certain
drugs
can
only
be
taken
via
certain
routes
for
example
nitroglycerin
can
not
be
swallowed
because
the
liver
would
inactivate
the
medication
but
it
can
be
taken
the
or
transdermal
through
the
skin
and
thus
is
absorbed
in
a
way
that
bypasses
the
portal
venous
system
inversely
dextromethorphan
a
cough
suppressor
is
best
taken
orally
because
it
needs
to
be
metabolised
by
the
liver
into
dextrorphan
in
order
to
be
effective
this
latter
principle
is
that
of
most
prodrugs
the
use
of
suppository
is
a
way
to
partially
the
the
upper
of
the
rectum
is
drained
into
the
while
the
lower
are
drained
into
the
iliac
that
goes
directly
in
the
vena
thus
the
flow
to
the
liver
is
unique
in
that
it
receives
both
oxygenated
and
partially
deoxygenated
blood
as
a
result
the
gas
of
oxygen
and
perfusion
pressure
of
portal
blood
are
lower
than
in
other
organs
of
the
body
blood
passes
from
branches
of
the
portal
vein
through
cavities
between
plates
of
hepatocytes
called
sinusoids
blood
also
flows
from
branches
of
the
and
mixes
in
the
sinusoids
to
supply
the
hepatocytes
with
oxygen
this
mixture
percolates
through
the
sinusoids
and
collects
in
a
central
vein
which
drains
into
the
the
hepatic
vein
subsequently
drains
into
the
vena
the
provides
to
of
the
oxygen
to
the
liver
while
only
accounting
for
of
the
total
liver
blood
flow
the
rest
comes
from
the
partially
deoxygenated
blood
from
the
interestingly
the
liver
consumes
about
of
the
total
body
oxygen
when
at
rest
that
is
why
the
total
liver
blood
flow
is
quite
high
at
about
litre
a
minute
and
up
to
two
litres
a

is
