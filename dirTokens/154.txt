Mathematics
is
the
study
of
numbers
quantity
space
structure
and
change
Mathematics
is
used
throughout
the
world
as
an
essential
tool
in
many
fields
,
including
engineering
medicine
and
the
the
branch
of
mathematics
concerned
with
application
of
mathematical
knowledge
to
other
fields
,
inspires
and
makes
use
of
new
mathematical
discoveries
and
sometimes
leads
to
the
development
of

mathematical
disciplines

as
statistics

Mathematicians

engage
in
or
mathematics
for
its
own

without
having
any
application

mind

There
is
no
clear

and

speaking

a
graph
is
a
set
of
objects
called
points
nodes
or
vertices
connected
by
links
called
lines
or
edges
In
a
proper
graph
,
which
is
by
default
undirected
a
line
from
point
A
to
point
B
is
considered
to
be
the
same
thing
as
a
line
from
point
B
to
point
A
In
a
digraph

the
two
directions

counted
as
being
distinct
arcs
or
Typically
,
a
graph
is
depicted
in
diagrammatic
form
as
a
set
of
dots
-LRB-
for
the
points
,
vertices
,
or
nodes
-RRB-
,
joined
by
curves
-LRB-
for
the
lines
or
edges
-RRB-
.
Graphs
have
applications
in
both
mathematics
and
and
form
the
basic
object
of
study
in
.
of
graph
theory
are
generally
concerned
with
labeled
graphs
and
various
specializations
of
these
.
Many
problems
of
practical
interest
can
be
represented
by
graphs
.
The
link
structure
of
a
website
could
be
represented
by
a
directed
graph
:
the
vertices
are
the
web
pages
available
at
the
website
and
a
directed
edge
from
page
A
to
page
B
exists
if
and
only
if
A
contains
a
link
to
B
A
graph
structure
can
be
extended
by
assigning
a
weight
to
each
edge
of
the
graph
.
Graphs
with
weights
,
or
are
used
to
represent
structures
in
which
pairwise
connections
have
some
numerical
values
.
For
example
if
a
graph
represents
a
road
network
,
the
weights
could
represent
the
length
of
each
road
.
A
digraph
with
weighted
edges
in
the
context
of
graph
theory
is
called
a
network
Networks
have
many
uses
in
the
practical
side
of
graph
theory
