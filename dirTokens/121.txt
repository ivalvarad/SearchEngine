from

account
Mao
gave
to

included
in

According
to
Mao
,
he
and
Luo
Yixiu
were
the
subject
of
an
organised
by
their
respective
fathers
,
and
Luo
Helou
.
Luo
was
eighteen
and
Mao
just
fourteen
years
old
at
the
time
of
their
betrothal

Although
Mao
took
part
in

he
later
stated
that
he
was
unhappy

,
never
consummating

have
suggested
that

affected
