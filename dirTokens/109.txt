a
rodent
species
of
the
family
cricetidae
it
is
found
in
the
of
southeast
brazil
often
close
to
bamboo
thickets
it
can
be
distinguished
from
the
only
other
species
in
its
genus
by
the
absence
of
spines
among
the
formerly
believed
to
be
extinct
after
no
sightings
were
recorded
for
over
years
the
species
has
since
been
found
in
four
however
it
is
nowhere
common
and
all
of
these
are
forest
fragments
and
ongoing
deforestation
threatens
the
species
survival
for
these
reasons

the
dorsal
fur

which
gradually
fades
to
on
the
ventral
surface
the
hair
is
soft
and
this
distinguishes
from
the
only
other
species
in
the
genus
which
has
spines
mixed
in
with
the
hairs
they
also
differ

certain
skull

the
tail
is
brownish
and
has
small

it
is
sparsely

in
blackish
hairs
that
get
longer
near
the

and
form
a

the

are
broad
with
bare

the

brazilian
arboreal
mouse
was
first
described
in
from
de
janeiro
in
brazil
but
it
has
not
been
found
in
that
locality
for
over
one
hundred
years
and
was
believed
to
be
extinct
however
it
has
now
been
found
in
four
other
localities
in
brazil
near
ubatuba
in
paulo
including
in
state
and
near
in

it
typically
lives
in
atlantic

ecology

is
known
about
this
species
and
its
natural
history
several
specimens
were
caught
in
sunk
in
the
ground
but
it
is
thought
that
it
is
an
arboreal
rodent
or
one
that
scrambles
among
the
undergrowth
because
of
the
morphology
of
its
feet
examination
of
the
stomach
contents
of
one
individual
that
was
caught
showed
that
it
had
eaten
