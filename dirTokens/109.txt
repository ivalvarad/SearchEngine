Brazilian
arboreal
mouse
is
a
small
mouse
with
small
rounded
ears
and
vibrissae
-LRB-
whiskers
-RRB-
long
enough
to
reach
the
ears
.
The
dorsal
fur
is
reddish-brown
which
gradually
fades
to
reddish-grey
on
the
ventral
surface
.
The
hair
is
soft
,
and
this
distinguishes
from
the
only
other
species
in
the
genus
,
which
has
spines
mixed
in
with
the
hairs
.
They
also
differ
in
certain
skull
characteristics

The
head-and-body
length
slightly
exceeds
the
tail

The
tail
is
brownish
and
has
small
scales
.
It
is
sparsely
clad
in
blackish
hairs
that
get
longer
near
the
tip
and
form
a
tuft
.
The
hind
feet
are
broad
with
bare
soles
and
fleshy
plantar
pads
.
The
hallux

a
nail
rather
than
a

a
unique

Brazilian
arboreal
mouse
was
first
described
in
1886
from
de
Janeiro
in
Brazil
but
it
has
not
been
found
in
that
locality
for
over
one
hundred
years
and
was
believed
to
be
extinct
However
,
it
has
now
been
found
in
four
other
localities
in
Brazil
,
near
Ubatuba
in
Paulo
including
in
State
and
near
Viçosa
in
Gerais
It
typically
lives
in
Atlantic
forest
,
often
among
bamboos
,
and
also
in
modified
forest

is
known
about
this
species
and
its
natural
history
.
Several
specimens
were
caught
in
sunk
in
the
ground
,
but
it
is
thought
that
it
is
an
arboreal
rodent
,
or
one
that
scrambles
among
the
undergrowth
,
because
of
the
morphology
of
its
feet
.
Examination
of
the
stomach
contents
of
one
individual
that
was
caught
showed
that
it
had
eaten
several
species
of
ant
.
