After
New
Spain
won
independence
from

,
it
was
decided
that
the
new
country
would
be
named
after
its
capital
,
which
was
founded
in
1524
on
top
of
the
ancient
Mexica
capital
of
Mexico-Tenochtitlan

was

''
.
However
,
one
attestation
in
the
late
16th-century
manuscript
known
as
``
the

dialogues
''
suggests
the

was

that

the

locative

.
Beyond
that
,
the
etymology
is
uncertain
.
It
has
been
suggested
that
it
is
derived
from
Mextli
or
Mēxihtli
,
a
secret
name
for
the
god
of
war
and
patron
of
the
Mexicas
,
Huitzilopochtli

case
Mēxihco
means
``

-LSB-
35
-RSB-
Another
-LSB-

-RSB-
suggests
that
Mēxihco
derives
from
a
portmanteau
of
the
Nahuatl
words
for
``
Moon
''
Mētztli
and
navel
xīctli
This
meaning
-LRB-
``
Place
at

''
-RRB-
might
then
refer

another

was
an
informal

hegemonic
empire
because
it
did
not

it

expected
