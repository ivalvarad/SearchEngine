vice

after
new

won
independence
from

it
was
decided
that
the
new
country
would
be
named
after
its
capital
which
was
founded
in
on

of
the
ancient
mexica
capital
of
its
name
was
thought
to
come
from
nahuatl
tetl
rock
and
and
is
often
thought
to
mean
among
the
prickly
pears
growing
among
rocks
however
one
attestation
in
the
late
manuscript
known
as
the
bancroft
dialogues
suggests
the
second
vowel
was
short
so
that
the
true
etymology
remains

is
the
nahuatl
locative
making
the
word
a
place
name
beyond
that
the
etymology
is
uncertain
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
is
derived
from
mextli
or
a
secret
name
for
the
god
of
war
and
patron
of
the
mexicas
huitzilopochtli
in
which
case
means
place
where
huitzilopochtli
another
suggests
that
derives
from
a
portmanteau
of
the
nahuatl
words
for
moon
and
navel
this
meaning
place
at
the
center
of
the
moon
might
then
refer
to

which
the
mesoamericans
pareidolically

hypothesis

it

transliterated
to
spanish
as
with
the
phonetic
value
of
the

in

spanish
which
represented
the
postalveolar
this
sound
as
well
as
the
postalveolar
represented
by
a
evolved
into
a
velar
x
during
the
century
this
led
to
the
use
of
the
variant

many
publications
in
spanish
most
notably
in
spain
whereas
in
mexico
and
most
other
spanish
speaking
countries

the
preferred
spelling
in
recent
years
the
academia
which
regulates
the
spanish
language
determined
that
both
variants
are
acceptable
in
spanish
but
that
the
normative
recommended
spelling
is
the

of

the
new

even
though
the
alternative

aztec

an
informal
or
hegemonic
empire
because
it
did
not
exert
supreme
authority
over
the
conquered
lands
it
merely
expected
tributes
to
be
paid
it
was
also
a
discontinuous
empire
because
not
all
dominated
territories
were
connected
for
example
the
southern
peripheral
zones
of
xoconochco
were
not
in

with

the
hegemonic
nature
of
the
aztec
empire
can
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
generally
local
rulers
were
restored
to
their
positions
once
their
was
conquered
and
the

did
not
interfere

american
populations
revealing

of
mtdna
lineages

of
native
american
origin
with
the
remainder
having
european

thus
the
observed
frequency
of

in
americans
is
higher
than
was
expected
on
the
basis
of
autosomal
estimates
of

the
difference
is
indicative
of
directional
mating
involving
preferentially
immigrant
men

this

of
genetic
asymmetry
has
been
observed
in
other
populations
including
brazilian
individuals
of
african
ancestry
as
the
analysis
of
sex
specific
and
autosomal
markers
has
revealed
evidence
for
substantial
european
admixture
