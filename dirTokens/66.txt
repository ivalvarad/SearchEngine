This
served
adequately
until
the
introduction
of
rail
travel
in
Britain
,
which
made
it
possible
to
travel
fast
enough
over
long
distances
to
require
continuous
re-setting
of
timepieces
as
a
train
progressed
in
its
daily
run
through
several
towns
.
Greenwich
Mean
Time
,
where
all
clocks
in
Britain
were
set
to
the
same
time
,
was
established
to
solve
this
problem
.
Chronometers
or
telegraphy
were
used
to
synchronize
these
-LSB-

-RSB-
Standard
time
zones
of
the
world
since
2015
.
The
number
at
the
bottom
of
each
timezone
specifies
the
number
of
hours
to
add
to
UTC
to
convert
it
to
the
local
time
,
as
originally
proposed
by
Scottish-Canadian
Sir
in
1879
,
divided
the
world
into
twenty-four
each
one
covering
15
degrees
of
longitude
.
All
clocks
within
each
zone
would
be
set
to
the
same
time
as
the
others
,
but
differed
by
one
hour
from
those
in
the
neighboring
zones
.
The
local
time
at
the
Greenwich
in
Greenwich
,
England
was
adopted
as
standard
on
22
October
1884
at
the
end
of
the
Meridian
,
-LSB-

-RSB-
leading
to
the
widespread
use
of
Greenwich
Mean
Time
to
set
local
clocks
.
This
location
was
chosen
because
by
1884
two-thirds
of
all
and
maps
already
used
it
as
their
prime
-LSB-

The
conference
did
not
adopt
Fleming
's
time
zones
because
they
were
outside
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
called
,
which
was
to
choose
a
basis
for
universal
time
-LRB-
as
well
as
a
prime
the
period
between
1848
to
1972
,
all
of
the
major
countries
adopted
time
zones
based
on
the
Greenwich
-LSB-

-RSB-
1935
,
the
term
was
recommended
by
the
Astronomical
as
a
more
precise
term
than
Greenwich
Mean
Time
,
because
GMT
could
refer
to
either
an
starting
at
noon
or
a
civil
day
starting
at
-LSB-

-RSB-
The
term

persists
,
however
,
in
common
usage
to
this

in
reference
to
.
Measurement
on
the
rotation
of
the
Earth
,
time
can
be
measured
by
observing
celestial
bodies
crossing
the
meridian
every
day
.
Astronomers
found
that
it
was
more
accurate
to
establish
time
by
observing
stars
as
they
crossed
a
meridian
rather
than
by
observing
the
position
of
the
Sun
in
the
sky
.
Nowadays
,
UT
in
relation
to
Atomic

-RRB-
is
determined
by
Long

observations
of
distant

Furthermore
,
the
length
of
the
second
was
determined
from
observations
of
the
Moon
between
1750
and
1890
.
All
of
these
factors
cause
the
solar
on
the
average
,
to
be
slightly
longer
than
the
nominal
86,400
SI
seconds
,
the
traditional
number
of
seconds
per

.
As
UT
is
slightly
irregular
in
its
rate
,
astronomers
introduced
which
has
since
been
replaced
by
-LRB-
TT
-RRB-
.
Because
Universal
Time
is
synchronous
with
night
and
day
,
and
more
precise
atomic-frequency
standards
drift
away
from
this
,
however
,
UT
is
still
used
to
produce
a

called
a

in

to
obtain

UT0
is
Universal
Time
determined
at
an
observatory
by
observing
the
diurnal
motion
of
stars
or
extragalactic
radio
sources
,
and
also
from
ranging
observations
of
the
Moon
and
artificial
Earth
satellites
.
The
location
of
the
observatory
is
considered
to
have
fixed
coordinates
in
a
terrestrial
reference
frame
-LRB-
such
as
the
Terrestrial

but
the
position

over

surface
of

;
this
is
known
as
UT0
does
not
contain
any
correction
for
polar

.
The
difference
between
UT0
and
UT1
is
on
the
order
of
a
few
tens
of

.
The
designation

-RSB-
UT1
is
the
principal
form
of
Universal
Time
.
While
conceptually
it
is
mean
solar
time
at
0
°
longitude
,
precise
measurements
of
the
Sun
are
difficult
.
Hence
,
it
is
computed
from
observations
of
distant
quasars
using
long
baseline
interferometry
,
laser
ranging
of
the
Moon
and
artificial
satellites
,
as
well
as
the
determination
of
GPS
satellite
orbits
.
UT1
is
the
same
everywhere
on

,
and
is
proportional
to
the

angle
of

with
