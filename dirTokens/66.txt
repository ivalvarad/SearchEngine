in

the

is
ambiguous
when
accuracy

is
required
as
there
are
several

of

most
commonly
used
being

and
see
all
of
these
versions
of

except
for

are
based
on
earth

relative
to

celestial
objects

and

the
introduction

throughout
the
civilized
world
set
its
official
clock
if
it
had
one
according
to
the
local
position
of
the
sun
see
this
served
adequately
until
the
introduction
of
rail
travel
in
britain
which
made
it
possible
to
travel
fast
enough
over
long
distances
to
require
continuous
of
timepieces
as
a
train
progressed
in
its
daily
run
through
several
towns
greenwich
mean
time
where
all
clocks
in
britain
were
set
to
the
same
time
was
established
to
solve
this
problem
chronometers
or
telegraphy
were
used
to
synchronize
these
standard
time
zones
of
the
world
since
the
number
at
the
bottom
of
each
timezone
specifies
the
number
of
hours
to
add
to
utc
to
convert
it
to
the
local
time
as
originally
proposed
by
sir
in
divided
the
world
into
each
one
covering
degrees
of
longitude
all
clocks
within
each
zone
would
be
set
to
the
same
time
as
the
others
but
differed
by
one
hour
from
those
in
the
neighboring
zones
the
local
time
at
the
greenwich
in
greenwich
england
was
adopted
as
standard
on
october
at
the
end
of
the
meridian
leading
to
the
widespread
use
of
greenwich
mean
time
to
set
local
clocks
this
location
was
chosen
because
by
of
all
and
maps
already
used
it
as
their
prime
the
conference
did
not
adopt
fleming
time
zones
because
they
were
outside
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
called
which
was
to
choose
a
basis
for
universal
time
as
well
as
a
prime
the
period
between
to
all
of
the
major
countries
adopted
time
zones
based
on
the
greenwich
the
term
was
recommended
by
the
astronomical
as
a
more
precise
term
than
greenwich
mean
time
because
gmt
could
refer
to
either
an
starting
at
noon
or
a
civil
day
starting
at
the
term
mean
persists
however
in
common
usage
to
this
day
in
reference
to
measurement
on
the
rotation
of
the
earth
time
can
be
measured
by
observing
celestial
bodies
crossing
the
meridian
every
day
astronomers
found
that
it
was
more
accurate
to
establish
time
by
observing
stars
as
they
crossed
a
meridian
rather
than
by
observing
the
position
of
the
sun
in
the
sky
nowadays
ut
in
relation
to
atomic
tai
is
determined
by
long
baseline
vlbi
observations
of
distant
quasars
a
method
which
can
determine

earth

ut

monitored
by
the
earth
rotation
and
reference
systems
iers
the
astronomical
also
is
involved
in
setting
standards
but
the
final
arbiter
of
broadcast
standards
is
the
telecommunication
or
rotation

the
earth

somewhat
irregular
and
is
very
gradually
slowing
due
to
furthermore
the
length
of

determined
from
observations
of
the
moon
between
and
all
of
these
factors
cause
the
solar

the
average
to
be
slightly
longer
than
the
nominal
si
seconds
the
traditional
number
of
seconds
per
day
as
ut
is
slightly
irregular
in
its
rate
astronomers
introduced
which
has
since
been
replaced
by
tt
because
universal
time
is
synchronous
with
night
and
day
and
more
precise
standards
drift
away
from
this
however
ut
is
still
used
to
produce
a
correction
called
a
to
atomic
time
in
order
to
obtain
a
broadcast
form
of
that
carries
atomic
frequency
thus
civil
broadcast
standards
for
time
and
frequency
usually
follow
international
atomic
time
closely
but
occasionally
step
or
leap
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
drifting
too
far
from

next
the
time

not

therefore
are
not
