the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
while
highlighting
such
soviet
successes
as
having
the
most
doctors

hospitals
in
the

recognized
the

areas
for
improvement
and
felt

up
this

in

was
seen
by
some
that
the
was
superior
to
the
these
improvements
continued
into
the
when
the
life
expectancy
in
the
soviet
union
surpassed
that
of
the
united
states
it
remained
stable
during
most
years
although
in
the
it
went
down
slightly
possibly
because
of
at
the
same
time
infant
mortality
began
to
rise
after
the
government
stopped
publishing
statistics
on
this
this
trend
can
be
partly
explained
by
the
number
of
pregnancies
rising
drastically
in
the
asian
part
of
the
country
where
infant
mortality
was
highest
while
declining
markedly

soviet
government
headed
by
vladimir
lenin
gave
small

groups
their
own
writing
the
development
of
these
writing
systems
was
very
successful
even
though
some
flaws
were
detected
during
the
later
days
of
the
ussr
countries
with
the
same
multilingual
situation
implemented
similar
policies
a
serious
problem
when
creating
these
writing
systems
was
that
the
languages
differed
dialectally
greatly
from
each
when
a
language
had
been
given
a
writing
system
and
appeared
in
a
notable
publication
that
language
would
attain
official
language
status
there
were
many
minority
languages
which
never
received
their
own
writing
system
therefore
their
speakers
were
forced
to
have
a

are
examples
where
the
soviet
government
retreated
from
this
policy
most
notable
under
stalin
regime
where
education
was
discontinued
in
languages
which
were
not
widespread
enough
these
languages
were
then
assimilated
into
another
language
mostly
during
the
patriotic
some
minority
languages
were
banned
and
their
speakers
accused
of
collaborating
with
the
the
most
widely
spoken
of
the
soviet

many
languages
russian
functioned
as
an
official
