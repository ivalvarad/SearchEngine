new
evidence
shows
that
administrative
command
planning
and
Stalin
's
forced
industrialization
strategies
failed
in
the
1930s
and
beyond
.
The
economic
miracle
chronicled
in
official
hagiographies
and
until
recently
faithfully
recounted
in
Western
textbooks
has
no
basis
in
fact
.
It
is
the

artefact
not
of

relativity

the
Gerschenkron
effect
-RRB-
but
of
misapplying
to
the
calculation
of
growth
cost
prices
that
do
not
accurately
measure
competitive
value
.
The
standard
of
living
declined
during
the
1930s
in
response
to
Stalin
's
despotism
,
and
after
a
brief
improvement
following
his
death
,
lapsed
into
stagnation
.
Glasnost
and
post-communist
revelations
interpreted
as
a
whole
thus
provide
no

for

Rittersporn
Zemskov
's
relatively
favourable
characterization
of
the
methods
,
economic
achievements
and
human
costs
of
Stalinism
.
The
evidence
demonstrates
that
the
suppression
of
markets
and
the
oppression
of
vast
segments
of
the
population
were
economically
counterproductive
and
humanly
calamitous
