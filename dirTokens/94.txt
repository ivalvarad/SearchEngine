even
more
severe
than

the

dominated

in
a
fashion
not
seen
since

this
was
because
of
the
destruction
of

as

the
from

but
was
never
able
to
overcome
wide
perceptions
that
it
was
merely
a
western
protest
party
the
quebec
nationalists
who
had
once
supported
the
tories
largely
switched
their
support
to
the
sovereigntist
while
the

ontario
support
largely
moved

the

never

ever

quebecer
from
a

however
the
liberals
did
increase
their
support
in

because
of
infighting
within
the
bloc
in

although
the
liberals
finished
with

garner
in
an
the
opposition
parties
criticized
the
fiscal
update
and
announced
they
would
not
support
it
because
it
contained
no
stimulus
money
to
spur

economy
and
protect
workers
during
the
economic
with
the
conservative
party
only
holding
a
minority
of
the
seats
in
the
house
of
commons
the
government
would
be
defeated
if
the
opposition
parties
voted
against
the
fiscal
with
the
conservatives
unwilling
to
budge
on
the
proposals
outlined
in
the
fiscal
update
the
liberals
and
ndp
signed
an
agreement
to
form
a
with
a
written
pledge
of
support
from
the
bloc
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement
dion
would
be
sworn
in
as
prime
minister
however
he
would
only
serve
in
the
position
until
the
next
liberal
leader
was
chosen
dion
contacted
governor
general
and
advised
her
that
he
had
the
confidence
of
the
house
of
commons
if
prime
minister
harper
government
was
to
however
before
the
fiscal
update
could
be
voted
on
in
the
house
of
commons
prime
minister
harper
requested
the
governor
general
to
prorogue
parliament
till
january
which
she
polls
showed
canadians
were
split
on
the
idea
of
having
either
a
coalition
government
or
having
the
conservatives
continue
to
govern
it
was
clear
that
because
of
dion
personal
popularity
they
were
not
comfortable
with
him
becoming
prime
members
of
the
liberal
party
therefore
called
on
dion
to
resign
as
leader
immediately
and
for
an
interim
leader
to
be
chosen
this
person
would
become
the
prime
minister
in
the
event
that
the
conservatives
were
defeated
when
parliament
resumed
in
with
an
estimated
percent
of
the
liberal
caucus
wanting
ignatieff
to
be
named
interim
leader
dion
resigned
the
post
on
december
effective
december
upon
ignatieff
becoming
interim
leblanc
announced
on
the
same
day
that
he
was
abandoning
the
liberal
leadership
and
endorsing
ignatieff
as
the
next
the
following
day
rae
announced
he
was
also
dropping
out
of
the
race
and
was
placing
his
full
and
unqualified
support
to

the
edit
ignatieff
named
interim
leader
of
the
party
on
december
the
liberal
poll
numbers
saw
significant
gains
after
they
plummeted
with
the
signing
of
the
coalition
when
parliament
resumed
on
january
the
ignatieff
liberals
agreed
to
support
the
budget
as
long
as
it
included
regular
accountability
reports
which
the
conservatives
accepted
this
ended
the
possibility
of
the
coalition
government
with
the
new
graph
of
opinion
polls
conducted
between
the
and
the
winter
of
showed
that
while
the
ignatieff
led
liberals
still
trailed
the
conservatives
their
support
had
stabilized
in
the
low
percent
range
however
by
the
time
ignatieff
was
confirmed
as
party
leader
on
may
the
liberal
party
had
a
comfortable
lead
over
the
governing
after
a
summer
where
he
was
accused
of
being
missing
in
action
ignatieff
announced
on
august
that
the
liberals
would
not
support
the
minority

after
this
announcement
the

already

abstained

attempt

just
a
year
after
the
previous
one
was
reported
as
a
miscalculation
as
polls
showed
that
most
canadians
did
not
want
another
even
after
the

survived
the

motion
popularity
for
ignatieff
and
his

continued
to
over
the

and
a
half
with
the
exception
of
a
brief
period
in
early
support
for
the
liberals
remained
below
percent
and
behind
the
while
his
predecessor
dion
was
criticized
by
the
conservatives
as
a
weak
leader
ignatieff
was
attacked
as
a
political
march
ignatieff
introduced
a
motion
of
against
the
harper
government
to
attempt
to
force
a
federal
after
the
government
was
found
to
be
in
of
the
first
such
occurrence
in
the
house
of

passed
the
motion
by
liberals
had
considerable
momentum
when
the
writ
was
dropped
and
ignatieff
successfully
squeezed
ndp
leader
out
of
media
attention
by
issuing
challenges
to
harper
for
in
the
first
couple
weeks
of
the
campaign
ignatieff
kept
his
party
in
second
place
in
the
polls
and
his
personal
ratings
exceeded
that
of
layton
for
the
first
however
opponents
frequently
criticized
ignatieff
perceived
political
opportunism
particularly
during
the
when
layton
criticized
ignatieff
for
having
a
poor
attendance
record
for
commons
votes
saying
you
know
most
canadians
if
they
do
show
up
for
work
they
do
get
a
promotion
ignatieff
failed
to
defend
himself
against
these
charges
and
the
debates
were
said
to
be
a
turning
point
for
his
party
near
the
end
of
the
campaign
a
late
surge
in
support
for
layton
and
the
ndp
relegated
ignatieff
and
the
liberals
to
third

liberals
suffered
their

defeat
in

collapse
of

out

condition

steve
patten
identifies
four
party
systems
in
canada
political
first
party
system
emerged
from
colonial
politics
had
its
heyday
from
to
and
lasted
until
the
crisis
of
and
was
characterized
by
local
patronage
administered
by
the
two
largest
parties
the
liberals
and
the
second
system
emerged
following
the
first
world
war
and
had
its
heyday
from
and
was
characterized
by
regionalism
and
saw
the
emergence
of
several
protest
parties
such
as
the
progressives
the
credit
and
the
commonwealth
third
system
emerged
in
and
had
its
heyday
from
to
and
began
to
unravel
thereafter
the
two
largest
parties
were
challenged
by
a
strong
third
party
the
new
democratic
party
campaigns
during
this
era
became
more
national
in
scope
because
of
and
involved
a
greater
focus
on
leadership
the
dominant
policy
of
the
era
was
keynesian
fourth
party
system
has
involved
the
rise
of
the
the
and
the
merger
of
the
with
the
most
parties
moved
to
leadership
contests
and
campaign
finance
laws
were
reformed
in
the
fourth
party
system
has
been
characterized
by
policies
that
abandoned
keynesian
policies
but
maintained
the
welfare
shows
how
the
liberal
party
has
dominated
all
the
party
systems
using
different
approaches
it
began
with
a
clientelistic
approach
under
laurier
which
evolved
into
a
brokerage
system
of
the
and
under
the
saw
the
emergence
of
a
system
which
lasted
until
the
the
election
categorized
by
clarkson
as
an
electoral
earthquake
which
fragmented
the
party
system
saw
the
emergence
of
regional
politics
within
a
four
whereby
various
groups
championed
regional
issues
and
concerns
clarkson
concludes
that
the
inherent
bias
built
into
the
system
has
chiefly
benefited
the
in
the
wake
of
the
election
believed
in
a
theme
of
major
realignment
commentator
for
the
and
claimed
that
harper
has
completed
a
remarkable
reconstruction
of
a
canadian
political
landscape
that
endured
for
more
than
a
century
the
realignment
sees
both
old
parties
of
the
moderate
middle
the
progressive
conservatives
and
the
liberals
either
eliminated
or
maclean
said
that
the
election
marked
an
unprecedented
realignment
of
canadian
politics
as
the
conservatives
are
now
in
a
position
to
replace
the
liberals
as
the
natural
governing
party
in
canada
proclaimed
the
west
is
in
and
ontario
has
joined
it
noting
that
the
conservatives
accomplished
the
rare
feat
of
putting
together
a
majority
by
winning
in
both
ontario
and
the
western
provinces
difficult
because
of
traditionally
conflicting
interests
while
having
little
representation
in
liberal
landslide
in
leaving
alberta
and

the
only
two
provinces
in

party
however
those
in
yukon
alberta
saskatchewan
manitoba
ontario
