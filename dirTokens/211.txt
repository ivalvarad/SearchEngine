diagram
of
a

venous
system
for
example
this

in
the

the
of

a
venous
occurs
when
a
pools
into
another
capillary
bed
through
veins
without
first
going
through
the
heart
both
capillary
beds
and
the
that
connect
them
are
considered
part
of
the
portal
venous
are
relatively
uncommon
as
the
majority
of
capillary
beds
drain
into
veins
which
then
drain
into
the
heart
not
into
another
capillary
bed
portal
venous
systems
are
considered
venous
because
the
blood
vessels
that
join
the
two
capillary
beds
are
either
veins
or
venules
of
such
systems
include
the

unqualified
portal
venous
system
often
refers
to
the
hepatic
portal
system
for
this
reason
portal

most
commonly
refers

functional
significance
of
such
a
system
is
that
it
transports
products
of
one
region
directly
to
another
region
in
relatively
high
concentrations
if
the
heart
was
involved
in
the
blood
circulation
between
those
two
regions
those
products
would
be
spread
around

pathway
for
transport
of
venous
blood
from
spleen

of

tract
with
the
exception
of
the
inferior
part
of
the

is
through
the

portal
vein
the
portal
vein
is
formed
by
the
union
of

vein
posterior

body
ascending
towards

the
portal
vein
passes
posterior
to

superior
part
of
the
duodenum
and
enters
the
right
margin
of
the
lesser
omentum
it
is
anterior
to

foramen
and
posterior
to

which
is
slightly
to

artery
proper
which
is
slightly
to

on
approaching
the

the

divides
into
