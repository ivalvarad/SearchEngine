a
venous
occurs
when
a
pools
into
another
capillary
bed
through
veins
without
first
going
through
the
heart
.
Both
capillary
beds
and
the
that
connect
them
are
considered
part
of
the
portal
venous
are
relatively
uncommon
as
the
majority
of
capillary
beds
drain
into
veins
which
then
drain
into
the
heart
not
into
another
capillary
bed
.
Portal
venous
systems
are
considered
venous
because
the
blood
vessels
that
join
the
two
capillary
beds
are
either
veins
or
venules
.

functional
significance
of
such
a
system
is
that
it
transports
products
of
one
region
directly
to
another
region
in
relatively
high
concentrations
.
If
the

in

,
those

-LRB-
with
the
exception
of
the
inferior
part
of
the

-RRB-
is
through
the

vein
.
The
portal
vein
is
formed
by
the
union
of

vein

the

.
Ascending
towards
the
liver
,
the
portal
vein
passes
posterior
to
the
superior
part
of
the
duodenum
and
enters
the
right
margin
of
the
lesser
omentum
.
It
is
anterior
to
the
omental
foramen
and
posterior
to
both
the
bile
duct
,
which
is
slightly
to
the
right
,
and
the
hepatic
artery

,
which
is
slightly
to

.
On
approaching
the
liver
,
the
portal
vein
divides
into
right
and
left
branches
which
enter

parenchyma
.
It
gives
tributaries
:
