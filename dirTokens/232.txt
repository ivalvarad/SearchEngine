a
series
of
puzzles
that
must
be

and
simple

using
``
the
Aperture

Handheld
Portal
Device

,
a
device
that
can
create
inter-spatial
portals

two
flat

complete
each

using

with
the
promise
of
receiving
cake
when
all
the
puzzles
are
completed

The
game
's
unique
physics
allows
momentum
to
be
retained
through
portals
,
requiring
creative
use
of
portals
to
maneuver
through
the
test
chambers
.
This
gameplay
element

based
on
a
similar
concept

of

hired

Portal
was
acclaimed
as
one
of
the
most
original
games
of
2007
,
despite
being
considered
short
in
length
.
The
game
received
praise
for
its
unique
gameplay
and
darkly
humorous
story
.
It
received
acclaim
for
the
character
of

Not

,
over
four
million
copies
of
the

have
been
sold
since
its

.
The
game
's
popularity
has
led
to
official
merchandise
from
Valve
including
plush
Companion
Cubes
,
as
well
as
fan
recreations
of

representation
of
how
the
magnitude
of
-RRB-
is
conserved
through
portals
.
By
jumping
into
the
blue
portal
,
the
character
is
launched
out
of
the
orange
portal
and
onto
the
platform
on
the
more
advanced
portal
technique
.
The
character
builds
up
speed
using
two
blue
portals
,
to
reach
an
otherwise
unreachable
area
.
The
second
blue
portal
is
carefully
created
in
mid-air
,
after
exiting
the
orange
portal
for
the
first
time
,
destroying
the
first
blue
portal
in
the
Portal
the
player
controls
the
protagonist
,
Chell
from
a
as
she
is
challenged
to
navigate
through
a
series
of
rooms
using
the
Aperture
Science
Handheld
Portal
Device
,
or
portal
gun
,
under
the
watchful
supervision
of
the
artificial
intelligence
GLaDOS
The
portal
gun
can
create
two
distinct
portal
ends
,
orange
and
blue
.
The
portals
create
a
visual
and
physical
connection
between
two
different
locations
in
Neither
end
is
specifically
an
entrance
or
exit
;
all
objects
that
travel
through
one
portal
will
exit
through
the
other
.
An
important
aspect
of
the
game
's
physics
is
momentum
-LSB-
13
-RSB-
As
moving
objects
pass
through
portals
,
they
come
through
the
exit
portal
at
the
same
direction
that
the
exit
portal
is
facing
and
with
the
same
speed
with
which
they
passed
through
the
entrance
-LSB-
14
-RSB-
For
example
,
a
common
maneuver
is
to
jump
down
to
a
portal
on
the
floor
and
emerge
through
a
wall
,
flying
over
a
gap
or
another
obstacle
.
This
allows
the
player
to
launch
objects
or
Chell
over
great
distances
,
both
vertically
and
horizontally
,
referred
to
as
`
flinging
'
by

As
GLaDOS
puts
it
,
``
In
layman
's
terms
:
speedy
thing
goes
in
,
speedy
thing
comes
out
.
''
If
portal
ends
are
not
on
parallel
planes
,
the
character
passing
through
is
reoriented
to
be
upright
with
respect
to
gravity
after
leaving
a
portal
and
all
other
objects
in
the
game
that
can
fit
into
the
portal
ends
will
pass
through
the
portal
.
However
,
a
portal
shot
can
not
pass
through
an
open
portal
;
it
will
simply
deactivate
or
create
a
new
portal
in
an
offset
position
.
Creating
a
portal
end
instantly
deactivates
an
existing
portal
end
of
the
same
color
.
Moving
objects
,
glass
,
special
wall
surfaces
,
liquids
,
or
areas
that
are
too
small
will
not
be
able
to
anchor
portals
.
Chell
is
sometimes
provided
with
cubes
that
she
can
pick
up
and
use
to
climb
on
or
to
hold
down
large
buttons
that
open
doors
or
activate
mechanisms
.
Particle
fields
known
as
emancipation
grills
,
occasionally
called
``
fizzlers
''
in
the
developer
commentary
,
exist
at
the
end
of
all
and
within
some
test
chambers
;
when
passed
through
,
they
will
deactivate
any
active
portals
and
disintegrate
any
object
carried
through
.
The
fields
also
block
attempts

also
be
killed
by
objects
falling
through
portals
,
and
by
a

of

Unlike

there

Chell

The

an

,
began
in

in

A

incorporated

According

of
Portal
the
year
is
established
to
be
``
somewhere
in
2010
''
--
twelve
years
after
its
abandonment
.
The
game
begins
with
protagonist
Chell
waking
up
from
a
stasis
bed
and
hearing
instructions
and
warnings
from
GLaDOS
about
the
upcoming

This
part
of
the
game
involves
distinct
test
chambers
that
,
in
sequence
,
introduce
players
to
the
game
's
mechanics
.
GLaDOS
's
announcements
serve
not
only
to
instruct
Chell
and
help
her
progress
through
the
game
,
but
also
to
create

proceeds
through
the
empty
Enrichment
Center
,
interacting
only
with
GLaDOS
.
Over
the
course
of
the
game
,
GLaDOS
's
motives
are
hinted
to
be
more
sinister
than
her
helpful
demeanor
suggests
.
Although
she
is
designed
to
appear
helpful
and
encouraging
,
GLaDOS
's
actions
and
speech
suggest
insincerity
and
callous
disregard
for
the
safety
and
well-being
of
the
test
subjects
.
The
test
chambers
become
increasingly
dangerous
as
Chell
proceeds
,
and
GLaDOS
even
directs
Chell
through
a
live-fire
course
designed
for
military
androids
as
a
result
of
``
mandatory
scheduled

in
the
regular

,
as
well
as
having

flooded
with

In

GLaDOS
boasts
about
the

of
the

a
waist-high

with
a

large
pink
heart
on

GLaDOS
becomes
panicked
and
insists
that
she
was
only
pretending
to
kill
Chell
,
as
part
of
testing
.
GLaDOS
then
asks
Chell
to
assume
the
``
party
escort
submission
position
''
,
lying
face-first
on
the
ground
,
so
that
a
``

associate
''
can
take
her
to
her
reward
.
Chell
continues
forward
.
Throughout
this
section
,
GLaDOS
still
sends
messages
to
Chell
and
it
becomes
clear
that
she
has
become
corrupt
and
may
have
killed
everyone
else
in
the
center
.
Chell
makes
her
way
through
the
maintenance
areas
and
empty
office
spaces
behind
the
chambers
,
sometimes
following
graffiti
messages
which
point
in
the
right
direction
.
These
backstage
areas
,
which
are
in
an
extremely
dilapidated
state
,
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
pristine
test
chambers
.
The
graffiti
includes
statements
such
as
``
the

is
a
lie
''
and
pastiches
of
poem
``
The

''
,
Wadsworth
``
The

``

attempts
to
dissuade
Chell
with
threats
of
physical
harm
and
misleading
statements
claiming
that
she
is
going
the
wrong
way
as
Chell
makes
her
way
deeper
into
the
maintenance
areas
.
Eventually
,
Chell
reaches
a
large
chamber
where
GLaDOS
's
hardware
hangs
overhead
.
GLaDOS
continues
to
plead
with
and
threaten
Chell
,
but
during
the
exchange
one
of
GLaDOS
'
personality
core
spheres
falls
off
;
Chell
drops
it
in
an
incinerator
.
GLaDOS
reveals
that
Chell
has
just
destroyed
the
morality
core
,
which
the
Aperture
Science
employees
allegedly
installed
after
GLaDOS
flooded
the
enrichment
center
with
a
deadly
neurotoxin
,
and
goes
on
to
state
that
now
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
her
from
doing
so
once
again
.
A
six-minute
countdown
starts
as
Chell
dislodges
and
incinerates
more
pieces
of
GLaDOS
,
while
GLaDOS
attempts
to
discourage
her
both
verbally
,
with
a
series
of
taunts
and
increasingly
juvenile
insults
,
and
physically
by
firing
rockets
at
her
.
After
she
has
destroyed
the
final
piece
,
a
portal
malfunction
tears
the
room
apart
and
transports
everything
to
the
surface
.
Chell
is
then
seen
lying
outside
the
facility
's
gates
amid
the
remains
of
GLaDOS

A

The
