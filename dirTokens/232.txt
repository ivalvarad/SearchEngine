a

is
to
jump
down

a

on

emerge

all

final
hours
of

the

established
to
be
somewhere
in
twelve
years
after
its

the
game
begins
with
protagonist
chell
waking
up
from
a
stasis
bed
and
hearing
instructions
and
warnings
from
glados
about
the
upcoming
test
experience
this
part
of
the
game
involves
distinct
test
chambers
that
in
sequence
introduce
players
to
the
game
mechanics
glados
announcements
serve
not
only
to
instruct
chell

her
progress

also
to

through
the
empty

interacting
only
with
glados
over
the
course
of
the

glados
motives
are
hinted
to
be
more
sinister
than
her
helpful
demeanor
suggests
although
she
is
designed
to
appear
helpful
and
encouraging
glados
actions
and
speech
suggest
insincerity
and
callous
disregard
for
the
safety
and
of
the
test

the
test
chambers
become
increasingly
dangerous
as
chell
proceeds
and
glados
even
directs
chell
through
a
course
designed
for
military
androids
as
a
result
of
mandatory
scheduled
maintenance
in
the

heart
on

sic
kelvin
chell
escapes
with
the
use
of
the
portal
gun
and
makes
her
way
through
the
maintenance

within
the
enrichment
glados
becomes
panicked
and
insists
that
she
was
only
pretending
to
kill
chell
as
part
of
testing
glados
then
asks
chell
to
assume
the
party
escort
submission
position
lying
on
the
ground
so
that
a
party
associate
can
take
her
to
her
reward
chell
continues
forward
throughout
this
section
glados
still
sends
messages
to
chell
and
it
becomes
clear
that
she
has
become
corrupt
and
may
have
killed
everyone
else
in
the
center
chell
makes
her
way
through
the
maintenance
areas
and
empty
office
spaces
behind
the

sometimes
following

which
are

extremely
dilapidated

stand
in

the
graffiti
includes
statements
such

mourning

attempts
to
dissuade
chell
with
threats
of
physical
harm
and
misleading
statements
claiming
that
she
is
going
the
wrong
way
as
chell
makes
her
way
deeper
into
the
maintenance
areas
eventually
chell
reaches
a
large
chamber
where
glados
hardware
hangs
overhead
glados
continues
to
plead
with
and
threaten
chell
but
during
the
exchange
one
of
glados
personality

spheres
falls
off
chell
drops
it
in
an
incinerator
glados
reveals
that
chell
has
just
destroyed
the
morality
core
which
the
aperture
science
employees
allegedly
installed
after
glados
flooded
the
enrichment
center
with
a
deadly
neurotoxin
and
goes
on
to
state
that
now
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
her
from
doing
so
once
again
a
countdown
starts
as
chell
dislodges
and
incinerates
more
pieces
of
glados
while
glados
attempts
to
discourage
her
both
verbally
with
a
series
of
taunts
and
increasingly
juvenile
insults
and
physically
by
firing
rockets
at
her
after
she
has
destroyed
the
final
piece
a
portal
malfunction
tears
the
room
apart
and
transports
everything
to
the
surface
chell
is
then
seen
lying
outside
the
facility
gates
amid
the
remains
of
glados
one
of
the
final

changed
through
a

of
the

a

days

in

chell

away

princess
trying
to
escape
a
dungeon
was
dropped
in
favor
of
the
aperture
science
portal
took
approximately
two
years
and
four
months
to
complete
after
the
digipen
team
was
brought
into
and
no
more
than
ten
people
were
involved
with
its
portal
writer
who
along
with
fellow
writer
chet
faliszek
was
hired
by
valve
for
the
game
claimed
that
without
the
constraints
portal
would
not
be
as
good
a
portal
team
worked
with
series
writer
on
fitting
the
game
into
the
series
this
was
done
in
part
due
to
the
limited
art
capabilities
of
the
small
team
instead
of
creating
new
assets
for
portal
they
decided
to
tie
the
game
to
an
existing
allow
them
to
reuse
the
art
wolpaw
and
faliszek
were
put
to
work
on
the
dialogue
for
portal
the
concept
of
a
computer
ai
guiding
the
player
through
experimental
facilities
to
test
the
portal
gun
was
arrived
at
early
in
the
writing
they
drafted
early
lines
for
the
polite
ai
with
humorous
situations
such
as
requesting
the
player
character
to
assume
the
party
escort
submission
position
and
found
this
style
of
approach
to
be
to
the
game
they
wanted
to
create
ultimately
leading
to
the
creation
of
the
glados
glados
was
central
to
the
plot
as
wolpaw
notes
we
designed
the
game
to
have
a
very
clear
beginning
middle
and
end
and
we
wanted
glados
to
go
through
a
personality
shift
at
each
of
these
wolpaw
further
describes
the
idea
of
using
cake
as
the
reward
came
about
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
portal
development
process
we
sat
down
as
a
group
to
decide
what
philosopher
or
school
of
philosophy
our
game
would
be
based
on
that
was
followed
by
about
minutes
of
silence
and
then
someone
mentioned
that
a
lot
of
people
like
the
cake
element
along
with
additional
messages
given
to
the
player
in
the
areas
were
written
and
drawn
by
design
edit
a
typical
portal
test
chamber
with
both
of
the
player
colored
portals
opened
the
weighted
companion
cube
can
also
be
seen
the
clean
spartan
look
to
the
chambers
was
influenced
by
the
film
austere
settings
in
the
game
came
about
because
testers
spent
too
much
time
trying
to
complete
the
puzzles
using
decorative
but
elements
as
a
result
the
setting
was
minimized
to
make
the
usable
aspects
of
the
puzzle
easier
to
spot
using
the
clinical
feel
of
the
setting
in
the
film
as
while
there
were
plans
for
a
third
area
an
office
space
to
be
included
after
the
test
chambers
and
the
maintenance
areas
the
team
ran
out
of
time
to
include
they
also
dropped
the
introduction
of
the
rat
man
a
character
who
left
the
messages
in
the
maintenance
areas
to
avoid
creating
too
much
narrative
for
the
though
the
character
was
developed
further
in
a
comic
lab
rat
that
ties
portal
and
story
according
to
project
lead
kim
swift
the
final
battle
with
glados
went
through
many
iterations
including
having
the
player
chased
by
bond
which
was
partially
applied
to
the
turrets
where
the
player
would
have
needed
to
redirect
rockets
while
avoiding
turret
fire
and
a
chase
sequence
following
a
fleeing
glados
eventually
they
found
that
playtesters
enjoyed
a
rather
simple
puzzle
with
a
countdown
timer
near
the
end
swift
noted
time
pressure
makes
people
think
something
is
a
lot
more
complicated
than
it
really
is
and
wolpaw
admitted
it
was
really
cheap
to
make
the
neurotoxin
gas
in
order
to
simplify
the
dialogue

the
voice
of
the
antagonist
glados
erik
wolpaw
noted
when
we
were
still
fishing
around
for
the
turret
voice
ellen
did
a
sultry
version
it
did
work
for
the
turrets
but
we
liked
it
a
lot
and
so
a
slightly
modified
version
of
that
became
the
model
for
glados
final
performed
the
growling
and
snarling
voice
of
glados
final
personality
core
named
the
anger
weighted
companion
cube
inspiration
was
from
project
lead
kim
swift
with
additional
input
from
wolpaw
from
reading
some
declassified
government
interrogation
thing
whereby
isolation
leads
subjects
to
begin
to
attach
to
inanimate
swift
commented
we
had
a
long
level
called
box
marathon
we
wanted
players
to
bring
this
box
with
them
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
but
people
would
forget
about
the
box
so
we
added
dialogue
applied
the
heart
to
the
cube
and
continued
to
up
the
ante
until
people
became
attached
to
the
box
later
on
we
added
the
incineration
idea
the
artistic
expression
grew
from
the
wolpaw
further
noted
that
the
need
to
incinerate
the
weighted
companion
cube
came
as
a
result
of
the
final
boss
battle
design
they
recognized
they
had
not
introduced
the
idea
of
incineration
necessary
to
complete
the
boss
battle
and
by
training
the
player
to
do
it
with
the
weighted
companion
cube
found
the
narrative
way
stronger

its
