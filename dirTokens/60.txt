For

If

bargain
with

Contrary

that

The

over

You
say
that
this
disturbs
you
because
it
is
ninety-nine

I

We

Your

The
stress
in
negotiations
between
the

intensified
,
and
only

was
it
learned
that
the
decision
to
fire

was
made
locally
by
an
undetermined
Soviet
commander
acting
on

authority
.

Kennedy
recalled
members
of

to
the
White

and
ordered
that
a
message
immediately
be
sent
to
U

asking
the
Soviets
to
suspend
work
on
the
missiles
while
negotiations
were
carried
out
.
During
this
meeting
,
General
delivered
the
news
that
the
U-2
had
been
shot
down
.
Kennedy
had
earlier
claimed
he
would
order
an
attack
on
such
sites
if
fired
upon
,
but
he
decided
to
not
act
unless
another
attack
was
made
.
In
an
interview
40
years
later
,
McNamara
had
to
send
a
U-2
over
to
gain
reconnaissance
information
on
whether
the
Soviet
missiles
were
becoming
operational
.
We
believed
that
if
the
U-2
was
shot
down
that
--
the
Cubans
did
n't
have
capabilities
to
shoot
it
down
,
the
Soviets
did
--
we
believed
if
it
was
shot
down
,
it
would
be
shot
down
by
a
Soviet
surface-to-air-missile
unit
,
and
that
it
would
represent
a
decision
by
the
Soviets
to
escalate
the
conflict
.
And
therefore
,
before
we
sent
the
U-2
out
,
we
agreed
that
if
it
was
shot
down
we
would
n't
meet
,
we
'd
simply
attack
.
It
was
shot
down
on
Friday
...
Fortunately
,
we
changed
our
mind
,
we
thought
``
Well
,
it
might
have
been
an
accident
,
we
wo
n't
attack
.
''
Later
we
learned
that
Khrushchev
had
reasoned
just
as
we
did
:
we
send
over
the
U-2
,
if
it
was
shot
down
,
he
reasoned
we
would
believe
it
was
an
intentional
escalation
.
And
therefore
,
he
issued
orders
to
Pliyev
,
the
Soviet
commander
in
Cuba
,
to
instruct
all
of
his
batteries
not
to
shoot

Unknown
to
most

Robert

had
been
meeting
with
the
Soviet
Ambassador
in
Washington
to
discover
whether
these
intentions
were
genuine
.
The
EXCOMM
was
generally
against

would
undermine

emerged

new
plan
called
for
the
President
to
ignore
the
latest
message
and
instead
to
return
to
Khrushchev
's
earlier
one
.
Kennedy
was
initially
hesitant
,
feeling
that
Khrushchev
would
no
longer
accept
the
deal
because
a
new
one
had
been
offered
,
but

that

might

left

returned
45minutes

with
a

to
this

.
The

made
several
changes
,
had

typed
,
and
sent
the

smaller

argued
that

should
be
underscored
with
an
oral
message
to
Ambassador

stating
that
if
the
missiles
were
not
withdrawn
,
military
action
would
be
used
to

them

Dean

added
one
proviso

again

Scali
asked
why
the
two
letters
from
Khrushchev
were
so
different
,
and
Fomin
claimed
it
was
because
of
``
poor
communications

''
Scali
replied
that
the
claim
was
not
credible
and
shouted
that
he
thought
it
was
a
``
stinking
double
cross
.
''
He
went
on
to
claim
that
an
invasion
was
only
hours
away
,
at
which
point
Fomin
stated
that
a
response
to
the
US
message
was
expected
from
Khrushchev
shortly
,
and
he
urged
Scali
to
tell
the
State
Department
that
no
treachery
was
intended
.
Scali
said
that
he
did
not
think
anyone
would
believe
him
,
but
he
agreed
to
deliver
the
message

The

went
their
separate
ways

and
Scali
immediately
typed
out
a
memo
for

the
U.S.

,
it
was
well
understood
that
ignoring
the
second

Khrushchev
in
a
terrible
position
.
Military
preparations

During

thought
the

was
``

what

,
the

mentioned

in

Khrushchev
feared
that
Castro
's
hurt
pride
and
widespread
Cuban
indignation
over
the
concessions
he
had
made
to
Kennedy
might
lead
to
a
breakdown
of
the
agreement
between
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
U.S.
.
In
order
to
prevent
this
Khrushchev
decided
to
make
Cuba
a
special
offer
.
The
offer
was
to
give
Cuba
more
than

tactical
nuclear
weapons
that
had
been
shipped
to
Cuba
along
with
the
long-range
missiles
,
but
which
crucially
had
passed
completely
under
the
radar
of
U.S.
intelligence
.
Khrushchev
concluded
that
because
the
Americans
had
not
listed
the
missiles
on

list
of

the

Castro
over

deal
designed
to
prevent

breakdown
in
the
relations
between
Cuba
and
the
Soviet
Union
.
While
in
Havana
,
Mikoyan
witnessed
the
mood
swings
and
paranoia
of
Castro
,
who
was
convinced
that
Moscow
had
made
the
agreement
with
the
U.S.
at
the
expense
of
Cuba
's
defense
.
Mikoyan
,
on
his
own
initiative
,
decided
that
Castro
and
his
military
not
be
given
control
of
weapons
with
an
explosive
force
equal
to

Hiroshima-sized
bombs

defused
the
seemingly
intractable
situation
,
which
risked
re-escalating

crisis
,
on

22

During
a
tense
,
four-hour
meeting
,
Mikoyan
convinced
Castro
that
despite
Moscow

it
would
