by
placing
soviet
nuclear

misgivings
of
the
soviet
ambassador
in
havana
ivanovich
who
argued
that
castro
would
not
accept
the
deployment
of
these
khrushchev
faced
a
strategic
situation
where
the
was
perceived
to
have
a
splendid
capability
that
put
the
soviet
union
at
a
huge
disadvantage
in
the
soviets
had
only
icbms
capable
of
delivering
nuclear
warheads
to
the
from
inside
the
soviet
the
poor
accuracy
and
reliability
of
these
missiles
raised
serious
doubts
about
their
effectiveness
a
newer
more
reliable
generation
of
icbms
would
only
become
operational
after
therefore
soviet
nuclear
capability
in
placed
less
emphasis
on
icbms
than
on
medium
and
ballistic

mrbms
and
irbms
these
missiles
could
hit
american
allies

most
of
alaska
from
soviet
territory
but
not
the
of
the
graham
allison
the
director
of
center
for
science
and
international
points
out
the
soviet
union
could
right
the
nuclear
imbalance
by
deploying
new
icbms
on
its
own
soil
in
order
to
meet
the
threat
it
faced
in
and
it
had
very
few
options
moving
existing
nuclear
weapons
to
locations
from
which
they
could
reach
american
targets
was
second
reason
soviet
missiles
were
deployed
to
cuba
was
because
khrushchev
wanted
to
bring
west
berlin
the
democratic
enclave
within
communist
the
soviet
orbit
the
east
germans
and
soviets
considered
western
control
over
a
portion
of
berlin
a
grave
threat
to
for
this
reason
among
others
khrushchev
made
the
central
battlefield
of
the
cold
war
khrushchev
believed
that
if
the
did
nothing
over
the
missile
deployments
in
cuba
he
could
muscle
the
west
out
of
berlin
using
said
missiles
as
a
deterrent
to
western
in
berlin
if
the
tried
to
bargain
with
the
soviets
after
becoming
aware
of
the
missiles
khrushchev
could
demand
trading
the
missiles
for
west
berlin
since
berlin
was
strategically
more
important
than
cuba
the
trade
would
be
a
win
for
khrushchev
president
kennedy
recognized
this
the
advantage
is
from
khrushchev
point
of
view
he
takes
a
great
chance
but
there
are
quite
some
rewards
to
more
than
missiles
having
the
capability
to
strike
moscow
with
nuclear
warheads
were
in
italy
and
in
was
also
reacting
in
part
to
the
nuclear
threat
of
obsolescent
jupiter
ballistic
missiles
which
the
had
installed
in
turkey
during
april
early
a
group
of
soviet
military
and
missile
construction
specialists
accompanied
an
agricultural
delegation
to
havana
they
obtained
a
meeting
with
cuban
leader
the
cuban
leadership
had
a
strong
expectation
that
the
would
invade
cuba
again
and
they
enthusiastically
approved
the
idea
of
installing
nuclear
missiles
in
cuba
however
according
to
another
source
objected
to
the
missiles
deployment
that
would
have
made
him
look
like
a
soviet
puppet
but
was
persuaded
that
missiles
in
cuba
would
be
an
irritant
to
the
and
help
the
interests
of
the
entire
socialist
further
the
deployment
would
include
tactical
weapons
with
a
range
of
usable
only
against
naval
vessels
that
would
provide
a
nuclear
umbrella
for
attacks
upon
the
may
khrushchev
and
castro
agreed
to
place
strategic
nuclear
missiles
secretly
in
cuba
like
castro
khrushchev
felt
that
a
invasion
of
cuba
was
imminent
and
that
to
lose
cuba
would
do
great
harm
to
the
communist
cause
especially
in
latin
america
he
said
he
wanted
to
confront
the
americans
with
more
than
words
the
logical
answer
was
the
soviets
maintained
their
tight
secrecy
writing
their
plans
longhand
which
were
approved
by
on
july
and
khrushchev

kennedy
was
no

than
we
can

go

doing

they
ca
after

their
statements
permit

to
take
out

kill
a

then
do
nothing

the

chiefs
of

believed
that
the

would
seriously
alter
the

but
secretary

disagreed
he
was
convinced
that
the

would
not
affect

at

explicitly

the

less

a

the

that
if
cuba
should
possess
a
capacity
to
carry
out
offensive
actions
against

the
united

would
second
credibility
among

among

would
be
damaged
if
they
allowed
the
soviet

to
appear
to
redress
the

by
placing

in

edit
next
morning
october
kennedy
informed
the
excomm
that
he
believed
only
an
invasion
would
remove
the
missiles
from
cuba
however
he
was
persuaded
to
give
the
matter
time
and
continue
with
both
military
and
diplomatic
pressure
he
agreed
and
ordered
the
flights
over
the
island
to
be
increased
from
two
per
day
to
once
every
two
hours
he
also
ordered
a
crash
program
to
institute
a
new
civil
government
in
cuba
if
an
invasion
went
this
point
the
crisis
was
ostensibly
at
a
stalemate
the
ussr
had
shown
no
indication
that
they
would
back
down
and
had
made
several
comments
to
the
contrary
the
had
no
reason
to
believe
otherwise
and
was
in
the
early
stages
of
preparing
for
an
invasion
along
with
a
nuclear
strike
on
the
soviet
union
in
case
it
responded
militarily
which
was
edit
pm
edt
on
october
of
had
lunch
with
aleksandr
fomin
alias
of
spy
at
fomin
request
following
the
instructions
of
the
of
the
fomin
noted
war
seems
about
to
break
out
and
asked
scali
to
use
his
contacts
to
talk
to
his
friends
at
the
state
department
to
see
if
the
would
be
interested
in
a
diplomatic
solution
he
suggested
that
the
language
of
the
deal
would
contain
an
assurance
from
the
soviet
union
to
remove
the
weapons
under
un
supervision
and
that
castro
would
publicly
announce
that
he
would
not
accept
such
weapons
in
the
future
in
exchange
for
a
public
statement
by
the
that
it
would
never
invade
the
responded
by
asking
the
brazilian
government
to
pass
a
message
to
castro
that
the
would
be
unlikely
to
invade
if
the
missiles
were
president
we
and
you
ought
not
now
to
pull
on
the
ends
of
the
rope
in
which
you
have
tied
the
knot
of
war
because
the
more
the
two
of
us
pull
the
tighter
that
knot
will
be
tied
and
a
moment
may
come
when
that
knot
will
be
tied
so
tight
that
even
he
who
tied
it
will
not
have
the
strength
to
untie
it
and
then
it
will
be
necessary
to
cut
that
knot
and
what
that
would
mean
is
not
for
me
to
explain
to
you
because
you
yourself
understand
perfectly
of
what
terrible
forces
our
countries
if
there
is
no
intention
to
tighten
that
knot
and
thereby
to
doom
the
world
to
the
catastrophe
of
thermonuclear
war
then
let
us
not
only
relax
the
forces
pulling
on
the
ends
of
the
rope
let
us
take
measures
to
untie
that
knot
we
are
ready
for
from
chairman
khrushchev
to
president
kennedy
october
october
at
pm
edt
the
state
department
started
receiving
a
message
that
appeared
to
be
written
personally
by
khrushchev
it
was
saturday
at
am
in
moscow
the
long
letter
took
several
minutes
to
arrive
and
it
took
translators
additional
time
to
translate
and
transcribe
described
the
letter
as
very
long
and
emotional
khrushchev
reiterated
the
basic
outline
that
had
been
stated
to
john
scali
earlier
in
the
day
i
propose
we
for
our
part
will
declare
that
our
ships
bound
for
cuba
are
not
carrying
any
armaments
you
will
declare
that
the
united
states
will
not
invade
cuba
with
its
troops
and
will
not
support
any
other
forces
which
might
intend
to
invade
cuba
then
the
necessity
of
the
presence
of
our
military
specialists
in
cuba
will
disappear
at
pm
edt
news
of
fomin
offer
to
scali
was
finally
heard
and
was
interpreted
as
a
set
up
for
the
arrival
of
khrushchev
letter
the
letter
was
then
considered
official
and
accurate
although
it
was
later
learned
that
fomin
was
almost
certainly
operating
of
his
own
accord
without
official
backing
additional
study
of
the
letter
was
ordered
and
continued
into
the
edit
aggression
against
cuba
would
mean
nuclear
war
the
americans
speak
about
such
aggression
as
if
they
did
not
know
or
did
not
want
to
accept
this
fact
i
have
no
doubt
they
would
lose
such
a
war
che
october
with

guideline
on
a
launcher
an
installation
similar
to
this
one
shot
down
major
anderson
over
on
the
other
hand
was
convinced
that
an
invasion
of
cuba
was
soon
at
hand
and
on
october
he
sent
a
telegram
to
khrushchev
that
appeared
to
call
for
a
preemptive
nuclear
strike
on
the
however
in
a
interview
castro
said
of
his
recommendation
for
the
soviets
to
attack
america
before
they
made
any
move
against
cuba
after
i
seen
what
i
seen
and
knowing
what
i
know
now
it
was
worth
it
at
castro
also
ordered
all
weapons
in
cuba
to
fire
on
any
us
whereas
in
the
past
they
had
been
ordered
only
to
fire
on
groups
of
two
or
more
at
am
edt
on
october
the
cia
delivered
a
memo
reporting
that
three
of
the
four
missile
sites
at
san
cristobal
and
the
two
sites
at
sagua
la
grande
appeared
to
be
fully
operational
they
also
noted
that
the
cuban
military
continued
to
organize
for
action
although
they
were
under
order
not
to
initiate
action
unless
am
edt
on
october
began
broadcasting
a
message
from
khrushchev
contrary
to
the
letter
of
the
night
before
the
message
offered
a
new
trade
that
the
missiles
on
cuba
would
be
removed
in
exchange
for
the
removal
of
the
jupiter
missiles
from
italy
and
turkey
at
am
edt
the
executive
committee
met
again
to
discuss
the
situation
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
change
in
the
message
was
due
to
internal
debate
between
khrushchev
and
other
party
officials
in
the
kennedy
realized
that
he
would
be
in
an
insupportable
position
if
this
becomes
khrushchev
proposal
because
the
missiles
in
turkey
were
not
militarily
useful
and
were
being
removed
anyway
and
it
gon
na
to
any
man
at
the
united
nations
or
any
other
rational
man
it
will
look
like
a
very
fair
trade
national
security
adviser
mcgeorge
bundy
explained
why
khrushchev
public
acquiescence
could
not
be
considered
the
current
threat
to
peace
is
not
in
turkey
it
is
in
noted
that
another
tanker
the
grozny
was
about
miles
out
and
should
be
intercepted
he
also
noted
that
they
had
not
made
the
ussr
aware
of
the
blockade
line
and
suggested
relaying
this
information
to
them
via
at
the
united

down

carried

the
meeting
progressed
at
am
edt
a
new
message
began
to
arrive
from
khrushchev
the
message
stated
in
are
disturbed
over
cuba
you
say
that
this
disturbs
you
because
it
is
miles
by
sea
from
the
coast
of
the
united
states
of
america
but
you
have
placed
destructive
missile
weapons
which
you
call
offensive
in
italy
and
turkey
literally
next
to
us
i
therefore
make
this
proposal
we
are
willing
to
remove
from
cuba
the
means
which
you
regard
as
offensive
your
representatives
will
make
a
declaration
to
the
effect
that
the
united
states
will
remove
its
analogous
means
from
turkey
and
after
that
persons
entrusted
by
the
united
nations
security
council
could
inspect
on
the
spot
the
fulfillment
of
the
pledges
executive
committee
continued
to
meet
through
the
the
crisis
turkey
had
repeatedly
stated
that
it
would
be
upset
if
the
jupiter
missiles
were
removed
italy
prime
minister
fanfani
who
was
also
foreign
minister
offered
to
allow
withdrawal
of
the
missiles
deployed
in
apulia
as
a
bargaining
chip
he
gave
the
message
to
one
of
his
most
trusted
friends
the
general

was
in
new
york
to
attend
an
international
conference
on
satellite

broadcasting
unknown
to
the
soviets
the
regarded
the
jupiter
missiles
as
obsolescent
and
already
supplanted
by
the

submarine

its

operating
location
at

at
approximately
pm

the
aircraft
was
struck
by
a
nato
designation
sam
missile
launched
from
cuba
the
aircraft
was
shot
down
and
anderson
was
killed
the
stress
in
negotiations
between
the
ussr
and
the
intensified
and
only
later
was
it
learned
that
the
decision
to
fire
the
missile
was
made
locally
by
an
undetermined
soviet
commander
acting
on
his
own
authority
later
that
day
at
about
pm
edt
several
navy
aircraft
on
photoreconnaissance
missions
were
fired
pm
edt
kennedy
recalled
members
of
excomm
to
the
white
house
and
ordered
that
a
message
immediately
be
sent
to
u
thant
asking
the
soviets
to
suspend
work
on
the
missiles
while
negotiations
were
carried
out
during
this
meeting
general
delivered
the
news
that
the
had
been
shot
down
kennedy
had
earlier
claimed
he
would
order
an
attack
on
such
sites
if
fired
upon
but
he
decided
to
not
act
unless
another
attack
was
made
in
an
interview
years
later
mcnamara
had
to
send
a
over
to
gain
reconnaissance
information
on
whether
the
soviet
missiles
were
becoming
operational
we
believed
that
if
the
was
shot
down
that
the
cubans
did
have
capabilities
to
shoot
it
down
the
soviets
did
we
believed
if
it
was
shot
down
it
would
be
shot
down
by
a
soviet
unit
and
that
it
would
represent
a
decision
by
the
soviets
to
escalate
the
conflict
and
therefore
before
we
sent
the
out
we
agreed
that
if
it
was
shot
down
we
would
meet
we
simply
attack
it
was
shot
down
on
friday
fortunately
we
changed
our
mind
we
thought
well
it
might
have
been
an
accident
we
wo
attack
later
we
learned
that
khrushchev
had
reasoned
just
as
we
did
we
send
over
the
if
it
was
shot
down
he
reasoned
we
would
believe
it
was
an
intentional
escalation
and
therefore
he
issued
orders
to
pliyev
the
soviet
commander
in
cuba
to
instruct
all
of
his
batteries
not
to
shoot
down
the
the
edit
sent
by
both
kennedy
and
nikita
khrushchev
agreed
to
meet
at
the
yenching
palace
chinese
restaurant
in
the
neighborhood
of
washington
on
the
evening
of
october
kennedy
suggested
that
they
take
khrushchev
offer
to
trade
away
the
missiles
unknown
to
most
members
of
the
excomm
robert
kennedy
had
been
meeting
with
the
soviet
ambassador
in
washington
to
discover
whether
these
intentions
were
genuine
the
excomm
was
generally
against
the
proposal
because
it
would
undermine
nato
authority
and
the
turkish
government
had
repeatedly
stated
it
was
against
any
such
the
meeting
progressed
a
new
plan
emerged
and
kennedy
was
slowly
persuaded
the
new
plan
called
for
the
president
to
ignore
the
latest
message
and
instead
to
return
to
khrushchev
earlier
one
kennedy
was
initially
hesitant
feeling
that
khrushchev
would
no
longer
accept
the
deal
because
a
new
one
had
been
offered
but
argued
that
he
might
accept
it
white
house
special
counsel
and
adviser
and
robert
kennedy
left
the
meeting
and
returned
later
with
a
draft
letter
to
this
effect
the
president
made
several
changes
had
it
typed
and
sent
the
excomm
meeting
a
smaller
meeting
continued
in
the
the
group
argued
that
the
letter
should
be
underscored
with
an
oral
message
to
ambassador
dobrynin
stating
that
if
the
missiles
were
not
withdrawn
military
action
would
be
used
to
remove
them
dean
rusk
added
one
proviso
that
no
part
of
the
language
of
the
deal
would
mention
turkey
but
there
would
be
an
understanding
that
the
missiles
would
be
removed
voluntarily
in
the
immediate
aftermath
the
president
agreed
and
the
message
was
october
excomm
meeting
held
in
the
white
house
cabinet
room
president
kennedy
and
dean
rusk
request
fomin
and
scali
met
again
scali
asked
why
the
two
letters
from
khrushchev
were
so
different
and
fomin
claimed
it
was
because
of
poor
communications
scali
replied
that
the
claim
was
not
credible
and
shouted
that
he
thought
it
was
a
stinking
double
cross
he
went
on
to
claim
that
an
invasion
was
only
hours
away
at
which
point
fomin
stated
that
a
response
to
the
us
message
was
expected
from
khrushchev
shortly
and
he
urged
scali
to
tell
the
state
department
that
no
treachery
was
intended
scali
said
that
he
did
not
think
anyone
would
believe
him
but
he
agreed
to
deliver
the
message
the
two
went
their
separate
ways
and
scali
immediately
typed
out
a
memo
for
the
the
establishment
it
was
well
understood
that
ignoring
the
second
offer
and
returning
to
the
first
put
khrushchev
in
a
terrible
position
military
preparations
continued
and
all
active
duty
air
force
personnel
were
recalled
to
their
bases
for
possible
action
robert
kennedy
later
recalled
the
mood
we
had
not
abandoned
all
hope
but
what
hope
there
was
now
rested
with
khrushchev
revising
his
course
within
the
next
few
hours
it
was
a
hope
not
an
expectation
the
expectation
was
military
confrontation
by
tuesday
and
possibly
pm
edt
the
letter
drafted
earlier
in
the
day
was
delivered
the
message
read
as
i
read
your
letter
the
key
elements
of
your
proposals
which
seem
generally
acceptable
as
i
understand
them
are
as
follows
you
would
agree
to
remove
these
weapons
systems
from
cuba
under
appropriate
united
nations
observation
and
supervision
and
undertake
with
suitable
to
halt
the
further
introduction
of
such
weapon
systems
into
cuba
we
on
our
part
would
agree
upon
the
establishment
of
adequate
arrangements
through
the
united
nations
to
ensure
the
carrying
out
and
continuation
of
these
commitments
a
to
remove
promptly
the
quarantine
measures
now
in
effect
and
b
to
give
assurances
against
the
invasion
of
cuba
the
letter
was
also
released
directly
to
the
press
to
ensure
it
could
not
be
the
letter
delivered
a
deal
was
on
the
table
however
as
robert
kennedy
noted
there
was
little
expectation
it
would
be
accepted
at
pm
edt
the
excomm
met
again
to
review
the
actions
for
the
following
day
plans
were
drawn
up
for
air
strikes
on
the
missile
sites
as
well
as
other
economic
targets
notably
petroleum
storage
mcnamara
stated
that
they
had
to
have
two
things
ready
a
government
for
cuba
because
we
going
to
need
one
and
secondly
plans
for
how
to
respond
to
the
soviet
union
in
europe
because
sure
as
hell
they
going
to
do
something
am
edt
on
october
the
informed
its
nato
allies
that
the
situation
is
growing
shorter
the
united
states
may
find
it
necessary
within
a
very
short
time
in
its
interest
and
that
of
its
fellow
nations
in
the
western
hemisphere
to
take
whatever
military
action
may
be
necessary
to
add
to
the
concern
at
the
cia
reported
that
all
missiles
in
cuba
were
ready
for
a
us
navy
helicopter
hovers
over
soviet
submarine
forced
to
the
surface
by
us
naval
forces
in
the
caribbean
near
cuba
october
that
same
day
what
the
white
house
later
called
black
saturday
the
navy
dropped
a
series
of
signaling
practice
depth
charges
the
size
of
hand
on
a
soviet
submarine
at
the
blockade
line
unaware
that
it
was
armed
with
a
torpedo
with
orders
that
allowed
it
to
be
used
if
the
submarine
was
hulled
a
hole
in
the
hull
from
depth
charges
or
surface
the
decision
to
launch
these
required
agreement
from
all
three
officers
on
board
but
one
of
them
objected
and
so
the
launch
was
narrowly
the
same
day
a
spy
plane
made
an
accidental
unauthorized
overflight
of
the
soviet
union
far
eastern
the
soviets
responded
by
scrambling
mig
fighters
from
in
turn
the
americans
launched
fighters
armed
with
nuclear
missiles
over
the
bering
october
khrushchev
also
received
a
letter
from
castro
what
is
now
known
as
the
armageddon
letter
dated
interpreted
as
urging
the
use
of
nuclear
force
in
the
event
of
an
attack
on
i
believe
the
imperialists
aggressiveness
is
extremely
dangerous
and
if
they
actually
carry
out
the
brutal
act
of
invading
cuba
in
violation
of
international
law
and
morality
that
would
be
the
moment
to
eliminate
such
danger
forever
through
an
act
of
clear
legitimate
defense
however
harsh
and
terrible
the
solution
would
be
castro
edit
october
after
much
deliberation
between
the
soviet
union
and

cabinet
kennedy
secretly
agreed
to
remove
all
missiles
set
in
southern
italy
and
in
turkey
the
latter
on
the
border
of
the
soviet
union
in
exchange
for
khrushchev
removing
all
missiles
in
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
removing
the
missiles
from
italy
was
part
of
the
secret
agreement
although
khrushchev
wrote
in
his
memoirs
that
it
was
nevertheless
when
the
crisis
had
ended
mcnamara
gave
the
order
to
dismantle
the
missiles
in
both
italy
and
am
est
on
october
a
new
message
from
khrushchev
was
broadcast
on
radio
moscow
khrushchev
stated
that
the
soviet
government
in
addition
to
previously
issued
instructions
on
the
cessation
of
further
work
at
the
building
sites
for
the
weapons
has
issued
a
new
order
on
the
dismantling
of
the
weapons
which
you
describe
as
offensive
and
their
crating
and
return
to
the
soviet
immediately
responded
issuing
a
statement
calling
the
letter
an
important
and
constructive
contribution
to
peace
he
continued
this
with
a
formal
consider
my
letter
to
you
of
october
and
your
reply
of
today
as
firm
undertakings
on
the
part
of
both
our
governments
which
should
be
promptly
carried
out
the
us
will
make
a
statement
in
the
framework
of
the
security
council
in
reference
to
cuba
as
follows
it
will
declare
that
the
united
states
of
america
will
respect
the
inviolability
of
cuban
borders
its
sovereignty
that
it
take
the
pledge
not
to
interfere
in
internal
affairs
not
to
intrude
themselves
and
not
to
permit
our
territory
to
be
used
as
a
bridgehead
for
the
invasion
of
cuba
and
will
restrain
those
who
would
plan
to
carry
an
aggression
against
cuba
either
from
us
territory
or
from
the
territory
of
other
countries
neighboring
to
planned
statement
would
also
contain
suggestions
he
had
received
from
his
adviser
schlesinger
in
a
memorandum
for
the
president
describing
the
post
mortem
on
removal
of
missiles
in
cuba
november
nara
us
continued
the
blockade
and
in
the
following
days
aerial
reconnaissance
proved
that
the
soviets
were
making
progress
in
removing
the
missile
systems
the
missiles
and
their
support
equipment
were
loaded
onto
eight
soviet
ships
on
november
president
kennedy
addressed
the
via
radio
and
television
broadcasts
regarding
the
dismantlement
process
of
the
soviet
missile
bases
located
in
the
caribbean
the
ships
left
cuba
from
november
the
made
a
final
visual
check
as
each
of
the
ships
passed
the
blockade
line
further
diplomatic
efforts
were
required
to
remove
the
soviet
bombers
and
they
were
loaded
on
three
soviet
ships
on
december
and
concurrent
with
the
soviet
commitment
on
the
the
government
announced
the
end
of
the
blockade
effective
at
pm
est
on
november
the
time
when
the
kennedy
administration
thought
that
the
cuban
missile
crisis
was
resolved
nuclear
tactical
rockets
stayed
in
cuba
since
they
were
not
part
of
the
understandings
however
the
soviets
changed
their
minds
fearing
possible
future
cuban
militant
steps
and
on
november
the
deputy
prime
told
castro
that
those
rockets
with
the
nuclear
warheads
were
being
removed
his
negotiations
with
the
soviet
ambassador
robert
kennedy
informally
proposed
that
the
jupiter
missiles
in
turkey
would
be
removed
within
a
short
time
after
this
crisis
was
the
last
us
missiles
were
disassembled
by
april
and
were
flown
out
of
turkey
soon
practical
effect
of
this
pact
was
that
it
effectively
strengthened
castro
position
in
cuba
guaranteeing
that
the
would
not
invade
cuba
it
is
possible
that
khrushchev
only
placed
the
missiles
in
cuba
to
get
kennedy
to
remove
the
missiles
from
italy
and
turkey
and
that
the
soviets
had
no
intention
of
resorting
to
nuclear
war
if
they
were
by
the
because
the
withdrawal
of
the
jupiter
missiles
from
nato
bases
in
southern
italy
and
turkey
was
not
made
public
at
the
time
khrushchev
appeared
to
have
lost
the
conflict
and
become
weakened
the
perception
was
that
kennedy
had
won
the
contest
between
the
superpowers
and
khrushchev
had
been
humiliated
this
is
not
entirely
the
case
as
both
kennedy
and
khrushchev
took
every
step
to
avoid
full
conflict
despite
the
pressures
of
their
governments
khrushchev
held
power
for
another
two
aftermath
edit
the
jupiter
ballistic
missile
the
secretly
agreed
to
withdraw
these
missiles
from
italy
and
compromise
embarrassed
khrushchev
and
the
soviet
union
because
the
withdrawal
of
missiles
from
italy
and
turkey
was
a
secret
deal
between
kennedy
and
khrushchev
khrushchev
went
to
kennedy
thinking
that
the
crisis
was
getting
out
of
hand
the
soviets
were
seen
as
retreating
from
circumstances
that
they
had
started
khrushchev
fall
from
power
two
years
later
was
in
part
because
of
the
politburo
embarrassment
at
both
khrushchev
eventual
concessions
to
the
and
his
ineptitude
in
precipitating
the
crisis
in
the
first
place
according
to
dobrynin
the
top
soviet
leadership
took
the
cuban
outcome
as
a
blow
to
its
prestige
bordering
on
perceived
the
outcome
as
a
partial
betrayal
by
the
soviets
given
that
decisions
on
how
to
resolve
the
crisis
had
been
made
exclusively
by
kennedy
and
khrushchev
castro
was
especially
upset
that
certain
issues
of
interest
to
cuba
such
as
the
status
of
the
naval
base
in
were
not
addressed
this
caused
cuban
soviet
relations
to
deteriorate
for
years

cuba

to
be
protected

general

the
president
that
he
considered
the
resolution
of
the
cuban
missile
crisis
the
greatest
defeat
in
our
history
his
was
a
minority
he
had
pressed
for
an
immediate
invasion
of
cuba
as
soon
as
the
crisis
began
and
still
favored
invading
cuba
even
after
the
soviets
had
withdrawn
their
years
later
lemay
still
believed
that
we
could
have

schlesinger
a
historian
and
adviser
to
president
kennedy
told
public
in
an
interview
on
october
that
castro
did
not
want
the
missiles
but
that
khrushchev
had
pressured
castro
to
accept
them
castro
was
not
completely
happy
with
the
idea
but
the
cuban
national
directorate
of
the
revolution
accepted
them
to
protect
cuba
against
attack
and
to
aid
its
ally
the
soviet
schlesinger
believed
that
when
the
missiles
were
withdrawn
castro
was
angrier
with
khrushchev
than
he
was
with
kennedy
because
khrushchev
had
not
consulted
castro
before
deciding
to
remove
although
castro
was
infuriated
by
khrushchev
he
planned
on
striking
the
united
states
with
remaining
missiles
should
an
invasion
of
the
island
early
it
was
confirmed
that
soviet
forces
in
cuba
had
by
the
time
the
crisis
broke
received
tactical
nuclear
warheads
for
their
and
castro
stated
that
he
would
have
recommended
their
use
if
the
invaded

knowing
cuba
would
be
the
most
dangerous
moment
in
the
crisis
was
only
recognized
during
the
cuban
missile
crisis

many
of

soviet
project

foxtrot
submarine
which
unknown
to
the
us

with
a
nuclear
torpedo
running
out
of

the
soviet
submarine
was
surrounded
by
american
warships
and
desperately
needed
to

an
argument
broke
out

officers

officer
ivan
semonovich
maslennikov

savitsky

ready
accounts
differ
about
whether
commander
arkhipov
convinced
savitsky
not
to
make
the
attack
or
whether
savitsky
himself
finally

that
the
only
reasonable
choice
left

years
after

years
ago
the
cuban
missile
crisis
brought
the
world
to
the
brink
of
nuclear
disaster
during
the
standoff
us
president
john
kennedy
thought
the
chance
of
escalation
to
war
was
between
in
and
even
and
what
we
have
learned
in
later
decades
has
done
nothing
to
lengthen
those
odds
we
now
know
for
example
that
in
addition
to
ballistic
missiles
the
soviet
union
had
deployed
tactical
nuclear
weapons
to
cuba
and
the
local
soviet
commander
there
could
have
launched
these
weapons
without
additional
codes
or
commands
from
moscow
the
us
air
strike
and
invasion
that
were
scheduled
for
the
third
week
of
the
confrontation
would
likely
have
triggered
a
nuclear
response
against
american
ships
and
troops

khrushchev

he
defused
the
seemingly
intractable
situation
which
risked
the
crisis
on
november
during
a
tense
meeting
mikoyan
convinced
castro
that
despite
moscow
desire
to
help
it
would
be
in

of
an
unpublished
soviet
law
which
did
actually
exist
