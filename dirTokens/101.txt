the
reception

brings
with

three
major

according

his
opinion
the
majority
of

are
actually
economic
migrants
that
are
not
fleeing

the

also
thinks
that
migrants
that
are
crossing
czech
territory
in
order
to
go
to
germany
will
stay
in
czech
republic
when
germany
eventually
stops
accepting
them
which
would
then
make
czech

defend
its

end
up
in
