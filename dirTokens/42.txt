are
used
for
tactical
advantage
as
they
can
be
inserted
into
the
battlefield
from
the
air
,
thereby
allowing
them
to
be
positioned
in
areas
not
accessible
by
land
.
They
jump
out
of
airplanes
using
their
parachutes
to
land
safely
on
the
ground
.
It
is
one
of
the
three
types
of
``
forced
entry
''
strategic
techniques
for
entering
a
of
the
other
two
are
by
land
and
sea
.
The
ability
of
to
enter
the
battle
from
different
locations
allows
paratroopers
to
evade
fortifications
that
are
placed
to
prevent
attack
from
a
specific
direction
,
and
the
possible
use
of
paratroopers
forces
an
army
to
spread
their
defenses
to
protect
other
areas
which
would
otherwise
be
safe
by
virtue
of
the
geography
.
Another
common
use
for
paratroopers
is
to
establish
an
airhead
for
landing
other
doctrine
was
first
practically
applied
to
warfare
by
the
Italians
and
the
Soviets
During
War
however
,
the
two
countries
'
ground
forces
were
often
overstretched
,
leaving
their
elite
paratroopers
to
be
employed
as
regular
infantry
.
Paratroopers
Fallschirmjäger
were
first
used
extensively
by
the
Germans
during
World
War
II
and
later
in
the
war
also
by
the
western
Allies
.
Owing
to
the
limited
capacity
of
cargo
aircraft
of
the
period
-LRB-
for
example
the
Ju-52
they
rarely
,
if
ever
,
jumped
in
groups
much
larger
than
20
from
one
aircraft
.
In
English
language
parlance
,
this
load
of
paratroopers
is
called
a
``
stick
''
,
while
any
load
of
soldiers
gathered
for
air
movement
is
known
as
a
``
chalk
''
.
The
terms
come
from
the
common
use
of
white
chalk
on
the
sides
of
aircraft
and
vehicles
to
mark
and
update
numbers
of
personnel
and

World

,
paratroopers
most
often
used
parachutes
of
a
circular
or
round
design
.
These
parachutes
could
be
steered
to
a
small
degree
by
pulling
on
the
risers

straps
connecting
the
paratrooper

canopy
itself
.
German
paratroopers
,
whose
harnesses
had
only
a
single
riser
attached
at
the
back
,
could
not
manipulate
their
parachutes
in
such
a
manner
.
Today
,
paratroopers
still
use
round
parachutes
,
or
round
parachutes
modified
as
to
be
more
fully
controlled
with

The
parachutes
