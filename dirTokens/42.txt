are
used
for
tactical
advantage
as
they
can
be
inserted
into
the
battlefield
from
the
air
thereby
allowing
them
to
be
positioned
in
areas
not
accessible

they
jump
out
of

using
their
parachutes
to
land
safely

it
is
one
of
the
three
types
of
forced
entry
strategic
techniques
for
entering
a
of
the
other
two
are
by
land
and

the
ability
of
to
enter
the
battle
from
different
locations
allows
paratroopers
to
evade
fortifications
that
are
placed

army
to
spread
their
defenses

protect
other
areas
which
would
otherwise

safe

geography
another
common
use
for

to

doctrine
was
first
practically
applied
to
warfare
by

the
two
countries
ground
forces
were
often
overstretched
leaving
their
elite
paratroopers
to
be
employed
as
regular

paratroopers
were
first
used
extensively
by
the
germans
during
world
war
ii
and
later
in
the
war
also
by
the
western
allies
owing
to
the
limited

rarely
if
ever
jumped
in

much
larger

from

english
language
parlance
this
load
of
paratroopers
is
called
a
stick
while
any
load
of
soldiers
gathered
for
air
movement
is
known
as
a
chalk
the
terms
come
from
the
common
use
of
white
chalk
on
the
sides
of
aircraft
and
vehicles
to
mark
and

most
often
used
parachutes
of

circular

round
design
these
parachutes
could
be
steered

degree
by
pulling
on
the
risers
four
straps
connecting
the
paratrooper
harness
to
the
connectors
and
suspension
lines
which
attach

german
paratroopers
whose
harnesses
had
only
a
single
riser
attached
at
the
back
could
not
manipulate
their
parachutes
in
such
a
manner
today
paratroopers
still
use
round
parachutes
or
round
parachutes
modified
as
to
be
more
fully
controlled
with
toggles
the
parachutes
are
usually
deployed

suffered
significant
casualties
during

able

to

the
