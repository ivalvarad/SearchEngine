of

will
have
``

that

,
provides
the
federal

with
power
to
make
laws
with
respect
simply
to
``

''
.
In
conventional
terms
of
constitutional
interpretation
,
one
view
can
be
that
this
is
confined
to
different-sex
marriage
because
that
was
all
that
the
constitutional
framers
had
in
mind
,
while
another
view
can
be
that
``
marriage
''
should
be
understood
in
terms
of
current
public
perceptions
.
Under
this
power
,
the
federal
parliament
has
enacted
a
uniform
marriage
law
for
the
whole
of
Australia
,
the
Marriage
Act
1961
-LSB-
16
-RSB-
As
enacted
,
this
act
appeared
to
envisage
only
different-sex
marriage
.
However
,
to
avoid
doubt
it
was
amended
in
2004
to
include
in
its
interpretation
section
-LRB-
section
5
-RRB-
a
definition
of
``
marriage
''
as
``
the
union
of
a
man
and
a
woman
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others

marriage
power
,
as
with
most
of
the
federal

's
legislative
powers
,
is
held
concurrently
with
the
states
.
In
fact
,
marriage
was
regulated
mainly
by
the
states
until
the
federal
Marriage
Act
1961
introduced
uniform
marriage
law
for
the
whole
of
Australia
.
However
,
it
arguably
remained
unclear
whether
the
Marriage
Act
``
covers
the
field
''
of
the
topic
``
marriage
''
,
leaving
no
space
for
a
state
or
a
self-governing
territory
to
make
laws
with
respect
to

of
any
on

Commonwealth

stated
that
,
if

The

delivered
its
judgment
very
quickly
,
on

-LSB-

-RSB-
It
held
unanimously
that
the
whole
of
the
ACT
's
same-sex
marriage
act
was
``
inconsistent
''
with
the
federal
Marriage
Act
1961
and
``
of
no
-LSB-
31
-RSB-
inconsistency
identified
was
twofold
.
First
,
the
definition
of
``
marriage
''
in
the
ACT
act
was
inconsistent
with
that
in
the
Marriage
Act
.
Second
,
the
ACT
act
could
not
nevertheless
operate
concurrently
with
the
Marriage
Act
,
since
the
Marriage
Act
was
intended
to
be
``
a
comprehensive
and
exhaustive
statement
of
the
law
with
respect
to
the
creation
and
recognition
of
the
legal
status
of
-LSB-
32
-RSB-
That
exhaustiveness
extended
to
the
definition
of
marriage
;
the
Court
did
not
accept
the
ACT
's
contention
that
the
Marriage
Act
left
room
for
same-sex
marriage
simply
because
it
did
not
expressly
exclude
it
.
Nor
did
the
Court
accept
the
ACT
's
contention
that
the
Marriage
Act
and
the
ACT
act
``
do
not
regulate
the
same
status
of
`
marriage
'
''
.
After
all
,
the
Court
observed
,
``
as
both
the
short
title
and
the
long
title
to
the
ACT
Act
show
,
the

is
intended
to

for
''
.
-LSB-
33
-RSB-
The
Court
then
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
inconsistency
with
the
Family
Law
Act
1975
.
It
required
the
ACT
to
pay
the
Commonwealth
's
Court
did
not
spell
it
out
,
but
the
consequence
of
this
decision
is
not
that
the
ACT
act
is
void
.
Rather
,
the
act
is
``
of
no
effect
''
or
,
as
the
Court
-LSB-
34
-RSB-
The
Court
is
using
the
language
of
its
established
interpretation
of
Constitution
section
109
,
which
provides
that
a
state
law
will
be
``
invalid
''
to
the
extent
that
it
is
``
inconsistent
''
with
a
federal
law
.
The
Court
has
understood
``
invalid
''
in
section
109
to
mean
not
that
the
state
law
is
simply
void
but
that
it
is
``
inoperative
''
for
so
long
as
the
inconsistency
remains
;
if
that
federal
law
were
to
be
changed
so
as
to
remove
the
inconsistency
,
the
state
law
would

The
words
``
of
no
effect
''
in
section
28
-LRB-
1
-RRB-
of
the
ACT
self-government
act
appear
to
reflect
that
.
The
addition
of
concurrent
operation
-LRB-
which
is
not
in
Constitution
section
109
-RRB-
does
not
create
an
exception
to
inconsistency
as
such
,
but
specifies
a
circumstance
in
which
inconsistency
will
not
arise
.
The
Court
found
that
,
regarding
the
ACT
's
same-sex
marriage
act
,
this
circumstance
did
not
Court
did
not
refer
to
the
several
same-sex
``
marriage
''
ceremonies
that
had
already
taken
place
.
However
,
the
Court
made
it
clear
that
,
since
the
ACT
act
had
never
been
of
any
effect
and
the
Marriage
Act
is
exhaustive
,
the
only
type
of
marriage
that
can
be
contracted
in
Australia
was
and
is
that
provided
in
the
Marriage
-LSB-
36
-RSB-
It
follows
that
those
ceremonies
could
not
have
created
was
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
the
High
Court
is
normally
reluctant
to
determine
an
issue
that
does
not
need
to
be
determined
.
To
have
stopped
at
that
point
,
however
,
would
have
left
the
Commonwealth
,
the
ACT
and
the
states
that
have
been
contemplating
same-sex
marriage
legislation
in
limbo
as
to
what
they
might
do
next
.
One
option
would
have
been
for
a
state
to
enact
same-sex
marriage
legislation
and
wait
for
it
to
be
challenged
in
the
High
Court
--
probably
,
as
had
happened
with
the
ACT
act
,
after
marriages
under
that
legislation
had
already
taken
place
.
For
these
reasons
,
it
would
seem
,
the
Court
proceeded
to
decide
whether
the
marriage
power
,
Constitution
s
51
-LRB-
xxi
-RRB-
,
extends
to
same-sex
parties
to
the
case
had
agreed
that
the
marriage
power
extends
to
same-sex
marriage
.
The
Court
did
not
consider
itself
constrained
by
that
agreement
,
but
it
came
to
the
same
Court
rejected
the
conventional
options
in
constitutional
utility
of
adopting
or
applying
a
single
all-embracing
theory
of
constitutional
interpretation
has
been
denied
.
This
case
does
not
require
examination
of
those
theories
or
the
resolution
of
any
conflict
,
real
or
supposed
,
between
them
.
The
determinative
question
in
this
case
is
whether
s
51
-LRB-
xxi
-RRB-
is
to
be
construed
as
referring
only
to
the
particular
legal
status
of
``
marriage
''
which
could
be
formed
at
the
time
of
federation
-LRB-
having
the
legal
content
which
it
had
according
to
English
law
at
that
time
-RRB-
or
as
using
the
word
``
marriage
''
in
the
sense
of
a
``
topic
of
juristic
classification
''
.
For
the
reasons
that
follow
,
the
latter
construction
should
be
adopted
.
Debates
cast
in
terms
like
``
originalism
''
or
``
original
intent
''
-LRB-
evidently
intended
to
stand
in
opposition
to
``
contemporary
meaning
''
-RRB-
with
their
echoes
of
very
different
debates
in
other
jurisdictions
are
not
to
the
point
and
serve
only
to
obscure
much
more
than
they
-LSB-
37
-RSB-
the
word
``
marriage
''
in
Constitution
section
51
-LRB-
xxi
-RRB-
states
a
``
topic
of
juristic
classification
''
which
is
not
tied
to
any
historical
model
and
the
federal
parliament
can
legislate
as
it
wishes
within
that
topic
.
In
the
Court
's
view
,
same-sex
marriage
comes
within
the
can
now
be
uniform
federal
law
for
marriages
of
any
kind
.
The
most
direct
way
to
achieve
that
is
to
amend
the
Marriage
Act
,
to
provide
that
a
person
's
sex
is
not
a
criterion
of
eligibility
to
marry
.
The
Marriage
Act
would
retain
its
exclusivity
,
so
that
no
state
or
territory
would
be
able
to
legislate
about
marriage
of
any
kind
.
Owing
to
that
exclusivity
,
the
ACT
same-sex
marriage
act
would
remain
inconsistent
with
the
Marriage
Act
and
,
consequently
,
continue
to
be
of
