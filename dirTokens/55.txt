supported
by
all
eight

by

it

government
soon
retitled
the
bill
as
the

same

bill
with
the
aim
of
further
distinguishing
it
from
the
definition
of
marriage
in
the

act
further
proposed
amendments
to
the

that
would

created

rejected
by

october
the
capital
passed
the
bill
by
a
vote
of
in
the
member
the
passing
of
the
bill
was
seen
before
members
of
the
public
the
passing
of
the
bill
represents
the
first
time
any
jurisdiction
of
australia
has
passed
any
form
of
act
defines
marriage
for
its
own
purposes
as
the
union
of
people
of
the
same
sex
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
voluntarily
entered
into
for
life
other
than
a
marriage
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
marriage
challenge
to
the
edit
act
is
a
territory
operating
under
federal
legislation
the
australian
capital
territory
act
section
of
this
act
provides
that
legislation
by
the
act
legislative
assembly
will
have
no
effect
to
the
extent
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
a
federal
law
although
it
shall
be
taken
to
be
consistent
with
such
a
law
to
the
extent
that
it
is
capable
of
operating
concurrently
with
that
section
xxi
provides
the
federal
parliament
with
power
to
make
laws
with
respect
simply
to
marriage
in
conventional
terms
of
constitutional
interpretation
one
view
can
be
that
this
is
confined
to
marriage
because
that
was
all
that
the
constitutional
framers
had
in
mind
while
another
view
can
be
that
marriage
should
be
understood
in
terms
of
current
public
perceptions
under
this
power
the
federal
parliament
has
enacted
a
uniform
marriage
law
for
the
whole
of
australia
the
marriage
act
as
enacted
this
act
appeared
to
envisage
only
marriage
however
to
avoid
doubt
it
was
amended
in
to
include
in
its
interpretation
section
section
a
definition
of
marriage
as
the
union
of
a
man
and
a
woman
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
voluntarily
entered
into
for
marriage
power
as
with
most
of
the
federal
parliament
legislative
powers
is
held
concurrently
with
the
states
in
fact
marriage
was
regulated
mainly
by
the
states
until
the
federal
marriage
act
introduced
uniform
marriage
law
for
the
whole
of
australia
however
it
arguably
remained
unclear
whether
the
marriage
act
covers
the
field
of
the
topic
marriage
leaving
no
space
for
a
state
or
a
territory
to
make
laws
with
respect
to
marriage
of
any
on
october
commonwealth
stated
that
if
the
act
bill
were
passed
the
commonwealth
would
challenge
it
in
the
court
of
as
inconsistent
with
the
federal
marriage
that
is
it
would
be
inconsistent
with

in

if
the
commonwealth
were
to
lose
in
the
high

it
retained
the
option
of
introducing
federal
legislation
to
override
the
act
however
the
federal
government
could
not
have
been
confident
that
such
legislation
would
pass
since
it
had
a
majority
only
in
the
of
and
not
in
the
senate
this
act
chief
minister
maintained
that
the
act
had
every
legal
right
to
pass
the
bill
and
allow
marriage
in
the
act
and
labor
mlas
released
similar
statements
affirming
their
support
for
the
bill

stated
that
their
party
would
do
whatever
it
could
in
the
senate
to
stop
any
federal
legislation
that
would
override
the
act
commonwealth
marriage
act
simply
does
not
permit
of
the
possibility
that
a
state
or
territory
might
clothe
with
the
legal
status
of
marriage
or
a
form
of
marriage
a
union
of
these
kinds
it
leaves
no
room
for

to
create
a

to

court
of
the
high
court
v
edit
october
as
soon
as
the
act
had
passed
the
bill
the
commonwealth
government
requested
a
high
court
hearing
regarding
the
validity
of
this
following
several
directions
hearings
in
the
high
court
robert
french
announced
that
the
full
bench
of
the
court
would
hear
the
commonwealth
challenge
in
a
hearing
on
and
december
november
the
commonwealth
provided
the
high
court
with
its
written
which
argued
that
the
act
law
was
inconsistent
in
terms
of
the
australian
capital
territory
act
cth
with
the
federal
marriage
act
and
family
law
act
november
the
act
provided
its
written
submission
to
the
court
arguing
in
response
to
the
commonwealth
that
neither
the
marriage
act
cth
nor
the
family
law
act
cth
manifest
an
intention
to
be
an
exhaustive
or
exclusive
statement
of
the
australian
law
governing
the
institution
of
case
was
heard
by
a
on
the
court
delivered
its
judgment
very
quickly
on
it
held
unanimously
that
the
whole
of
the
act
marriage
act
was
inconsistent
with
the
federal
marriage
act
and
of
no
inconsistency
identified
was
twofold
first
the
definition
of
marriage
in
the
act
act
was
inconsistent
with
that
in
the
marriage
act
second
the
act
act
could
not
nevertheless
operate
concurrently
with
the
marriage
act
since
the
marriage
act
was
intended
to
be
a
comprehensive
and
exhaustive
statement
of
the
law
with
respect
to
the
creation
and
recognition
of
the
legal
status
of
that
exhaustiveness
extended
to
the
definition
of
marriage
the
court
did
not
accept
the
act
contention
that
the
marriage
act
left
room
for
marriage
simply
because
it
did
not
expressly
exclude
it
nor
did
the
court
accept
the
act
contention
that
the
marriage
act
and
the
act
act
do
not
regulate
the
same
status
of
marriage
after
all
the
court
observed
as
both
the
short
title
and
the
long
title
to
the
act
act
show
the
act
is
intended
to
provide
for
the
court
then
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
inconsistency
with
the
family
law
act
it
required
the
act
to
pay
the
commonwealth
court
did
not
spell
it
out
but
the
consequence
of
this
decision
is
not
that
the
act
act
is
void
rather
the
act
is
of
no
effect
or
as
the
court
the
court
is
using
the
language
of
its
established
interpretation
of
constitution
section
which
provides
that
a
state
law
will
be
invalid
to
the
extent
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
a
federal
law
the
court
has
understood
invalid
in
section
to
mean
not
that
the
state
law
is
simply
void
but
that
it
is
inoperative
for
so
long
as
the
inconsistency
remains
if
that
federal
law
were
to
be
changed
so
as
to
remove
the
inconsistency
the
state
law
would
the
words
of
no
effect
in
section
of
the
act
act
appear
to
reflect
that
the
addition
of
concurrent
operation
which
is
not
in
constitution
section
does
not
create
an
exception
to
inconsistency
as
such
but
specifies
a
circumstance
in
which
inconsistency
will
not
arise
the
court
found
that
regarding
the
act
marriage
act
this
circumstance
did
not
court
did
not
refer
to
the
several
marriage
ceremonies
that
had
already
taken
place
however
the
court
made
it
clear
that
since
the
act
act
had
never
been
of
any
effect
and
the
marriage
act
is
exhaustive
the
only
type
of
marriage
that
can
be
contracted
in
australia
was
and
is
that
provided
in
the
marriage
it
follows
that
those
ceremonies
could
not
have
created
was
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
the
high
court
is
normally
reluctant
to
determine
an
issue
that
does
not
need
to
be
determined
to
have
stopped
at
that
point
however
would
have
left
the
commonwealth
the
act
and
the
states
that
have
been
contemplating
marriage
legislation
in
limbo
as
to
what
they
might
do
next
one
option
would
have
been
for
a
state
to
enact
marriage
legislation
and
wait
for
it
to
be
challenged
in
the
high
court
probably
as
had
happened
with
the
act
act
after
marriages
under
that
legislation
had
already
taken
place
for
these
reasons
it
would
seem
the
court
proceeded
to
decide
whether
the
marriage
power
constitution
s
xxi
extends
to
parties
to
the
case
had
agreed
that
the
marriage
power
extends
to
marriage
the
court
did
not
consider
itself
constrained
by
that
agreement
but
it
came
to
the
same
court
rejected
the
conventional
options
in
constitutional
utility
of
adopting
or
applying
a
single
theory
of
constitutional
interpretation
has
been
denied
this
case
does
not
require
examination
of
those
theories
or
the
resolution
of
any
conflict
real
or
supposed
between
them
the
determinative
question
in
this
case
is
whether
s
xxi
is
to
be
construed
as
referring
only
to
the
particular
legal
status
of
marriage
which
could
be
formed
at
the
time
of
federation
having
the
legal
content
which
it
had
according
to
english
law
at
that
time
or
as
using
the
word
marriage
in
the
sense
of
a
topic
of
juristic
classification
for
the
reasons
that
follow
the
latter
construction
should
be
adopted
debates
cast
in
terms
like
originalism
or
original
intent
evidently
intended
to
stand
in
opposition
to
contemporary
meaning
with
their
echoes
of
very
different
debates
in
other
jurisdictions
are
not
to
the
point
and
serve
only
to
obscure
much
more
than
they
the
word
marriage
in
constitution
section
xxi
states
a
topic
of
juristic
classification
which
is
not
tied
to
any
historical
model
and
the
federal
parliament
can
legislate
as
it
wishes
within
that
topic
in
the
court
view
marriage
comes
within
the
can
now
be
uniform
federal
law
for
marriages
of
any
kind
the
most
direct
way
to
achieve
that
is
to
amend
the
marriage
act
to
provide
that
a
person
sex
is
not
a
criterion
of
eligibility
to
marry
the
marriage
act
would
retain
its
exclusivity
so
that
no
state
or
territory
would
be
able
to
legislate
about
marriage
of
any
kind
owing
to
that
exclusivity
the
act
marriage
act
would
remain
inconsistent
with
the
marriage
act
and
consequently
continue
to
be
of
no
