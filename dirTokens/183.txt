founded
as
an
offshoot

nupedia
a
project
to
produce
a
free
encyclopedia
nupedia
had
an
elaborate
system
of
and
required
highly
qualified
contributors
but
the
writing
of
articles
was
slow
during
founder
of
nupedia
and
whom
wales
had
employed
to
work
on
the
project
discussed
ways
of
supplementing
nupedia
with
a
more
open
complementary
project
multiple
sources
suggested
that
a
wiki
might
allow
members
of
the
public
to
contribute
material
and
nupedia
first
wiki
went
online
on
was
considerable
resistance
on
the
part
of
nupedia
editors
and
reviewers
to
the
idea
of
associating
nupedia
with
a
website
in
the
wiki
format
so
the
new
project
was
given
the
name
wikipedia

launched
on

this
is
one
simple
way
to
wikipedia
as
a
research
pages
with
and
wiki
documents
articles
are
never
considered
complete
and
may
be
continually
edited
and
improved
over
time
this
generally
results
in
an
upward
trend
of
quality
and
a
growing
consensus
over
a
neutral
representation
of
should
be
aware
that
not
all
articles
are
of
encyclopedic
quality
from
the
start
they
may
contain
false
or
debatable
information
indeed
many
articles
start
their
lives
as
displaying
a
single
viewpoint
and
after
a
long
process
of
discussion
debate
and
argument
they
gradually
take
on
a
point
of
reached
through
consensus
others
may
for
a
while
become
caught
up
in
a
heavily
unbalanced
viewpoint
which
can
take
some
time
months
or
years
perhaps
to
achieve
better
balanced
coverage
of
their
subject
in
part
this
is
because
editors
often
contribute
content
in
which
they
have
a
particular
interest
and
do
not
attempt
to
make
each
article
that
they
edit
comprehensive
however
eventually
additional
editors
expand
and
contribute
to
articles
and
strive
to
achieve
balance
and
comprehensive
coverage
in
addition
wikipedia
operates
a
number
of
internal
resolution
processes
that
can
assist
when
editors
disagree
on
content
and
approach
usually
editors
eventually
reach
a
consensus
on
ways
to
improve
the
ideal
wikipedia
article
is
well
written
balanced
neutral
and
encyclopedic
containing
comprehensive
notable
verifiable
knowledge
an
increasing
number
of
articles
reach
this
standard
over
time
and
many
already
have
our
best
articles
are
called
and
display
a
small
star
in
the
upper
right
corner
of
the
article
and
our
second
best
tier
of
articles
are
designated
however
this
is
a
process
and
can
take
months
or
years
to
be
achieved
through
the
concerted
effort
of
editors
some
articles
contain
statements
which
have
not
yet
been
fully
cited
others
will
later
be
augmented
with
new
sections
some
information
will
be
considered
by
later
contributors
to
be
insufficiently
founded
and
therefore
may
be
the
overall
trend
is
toward
improvement
it
is
important
to
use
wikipedia
carefully
if
it
is
intended
to
be
used
as
a
research
source
since
individual
articles
will
by
their
nature
vary
in
quality
and
maturity
and
information
are
available
to
help
users
and
researchers
do
this
effectively
as
is
an
article
that
summarizes
studies
and
assessments
of
the
of
vs
paper
article
is
not
on
has
advantages
over
traditional
paper
encyclopedias
wikipedia
has
a
very
low
publishing
cost
for
adding
or
expanding
entries
and
a
low
environmental
impact
some
since
it
never
needs
to
be
printed
although
computers
have
their
own
in
addition
wikipedia
has
wikilinks
instead
of
explanations
and
it
incorporates
overview
summaries
article
introductions
with
the
extensive
detail
of
full
articles
additionally
the
editorial
cycle
is
short
a
paper
encyclopedia
stays
the
same
until
the
next
edition
whereas
editors
can
update
wikipedia
at
any
instant
around
the
clock
keeping
articles
abreast
of
the
most
recent
events
and
weaknesses
and
article
quality
in
pages
wikipedia
is
so
and
wikipedia
is
not
so
also
of
and
with
greatest
strengths
weaknesses
and
differences
all
arise
because
it
is
open
to
anyone
it
has
a
large
contributor
base
and
its
articles
are
written
by
consensus
according
to
editorial
guidelines
and
is
to
a
large
contributor
drawing
a
large
number
of
editors
from
diverse
backgrounds
this
allows
wikipedia
to
significantly
reduce
regional
and
cultural
bias
found
in
many
other
publications
and
makes
it
very
difficult
for
any
group
to
and
impose
a
large
diverse
editor
base
also
provides
access
and
breadth
on
subject
matter
that
is
otherwise
inaccessible
or
little
documented
a
large
number
of
editors
contributing
at
any
moment
also
means
that
wikipedia
can
produce
encyclopedic
articles
and
resources
covering
newsworthy
events
within
hours
or
days
of
their
occurrence
it
also
means
that
like
any
publication
wikipedia
may
reflect
the
cultural
age
and
other
biases
of
its
contributors
there
is
no
systematic
process
to
make
sure
that
important
are
written
about
so
wikipedia
may
contain
unexpected
oversights
and
omissions
while
most
articles
may
be
altered
by
anyone
in
practice
editing
will
be
performed
by
a
certain
demographic
younger
rather
than
older
male
rather
than
female
rich
enough
to
afford
a
computer
rather
than
poor
et
cetera
and
may
therefore
show
some
bias
some
topics
may
not
be
covered
well
while
others
may
be
covered
in
great
to
wikipedia
means
that
it
is
more
easily
vandalized
or
susceptible
to
unchecked
information
which
requires
removal
see
intervention
against
while
blatant
vandalism
is
usually
easily
spotted
and
rapidly
corrected
wikipedia
is
more
subject
to
subtle
viewpoint
promotion
than
a
typical
reference
work
however
bias
that
would
be
unchallenged
in
a
traditional
reference
work
is
likely
to
be
ultimately
challenged
or
considered
on
wikipedia
while
wikipedia
articles
generally
attain
a
good
standard
after
editing
it
is
important
to
note
that
fledgling
articles
and
those
monitored
less
well
may
be
susceptible
to
vandalism
and
insertion
of
false
information
wikipedia
radical
openness
also
means
that
any
given
article
may
be
at
any
given
moment
in
a
bad
state
such
as
in
the
middle
of
a
large
edit
or
a
controversial
rewrite
many
contributors
do
not
yet
comply
fully
with
key
policies
or
may
add
information
without
citable
sources
wikipedia
open
approach
tremendously
increases
the
chances
that
any
particular
factual
error
or
misleading
statement
will
be
relatively
promptly
corrected
numerous
editors
at
any
given
time
are
monitoring
and
edits
to
articles
on
their
watchlists
is
by
open
and
transparent
approach
that
has
its
pros
and
cons
censorship
or
imposing
official
points
of
view
is
extremely
difficult
to
achieve
and
usually
fails
after
a
time
eventually
for
most
articles
all
notable
views
become
fairly
described
and
a
point
of
reached
in
reality
the
process
of
reaching
consensus
may
be
long
and
with
articles
fluid
or
changeable
for
a
long
time
while
they
find
their
neutral
approach
that
all
sides
can
agree
on
reaching
neutrality
is
occasionally
made
harder
by
wikipedia
operates
a
full
editorial
dispute
resolution
process
one
that
allows
time
for
discussion
and
resolution
in
depth
but
one
that
also
permits
disagreements
to
last
for
months
before
or
biased
edits
are
removed
a
common
conclusion
is
that
wikipedia
is
a
valuable
resource
and
provides
a
good
reference
point
on
its
said
articles
and
subject
areas
sometimes
suffer
from
significant
omissions
and
while
misinformation
and
vandalism
are
usually
corrected
quickly
this
does
not
always
happen
see
for
example
in
which
a
person
inserted
a
fake
biography
linking
a
prominent
journalist
to
the
kennedy
assassinations
and
soviet
russia
as
a
joke
on
a
which
went
undetected
for
four
months
saying
afterwards
he
did
know
wikipedia
was
used
as
a
serious
reference
is
largely
by
those
with
expert
credentials
are
given
no
additional
weight
wikipedia
is
also
not
subject
to
any
peer
review
for
scientific
medical
or
engineering
articles
one
advantage
to
having
amateurs
write
in
wikipedia
is
that
they
have
more
free
time
on
their
hands
so
that
they
can
make
rapid
changes
in
response
to
current
events
the
wider
the
general
public
interest

a
topic
the
more
likely
it
is
