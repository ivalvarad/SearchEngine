consider

for
example
if
you
want
to
write
an
article
about

you
might
search
for

and
then
add

for
the

you
will
be

of

in

must
be
sufficiently
notable
and
that
notability
must
be

through
citations
to

the

you

must
be
reliable
that
is
they
must
be

that
exercise
some
form
of
editorial
control
and
have
some
reputation
for
fact
checking
and
accuracy
print
sources
and
versions
of
those
sources
tend
to
be
the
most
reliable
though
some
sources
may
also
be
reliable
examples
might
include
but
are
not
limited
to
books
published
by
major
publishing
houses
newspapers
magazines
scholarly
journals
websites
of
any
of
the
above
and
other
websites
that
meet
the
same
requirements
as
a
reputable
general
sources
with
no
editorial
control
are
not
reliable
these
include
but
are
not
limited
to
books
published
by
vanity

forums
usenet
discussions
personal
social

fan
sites
vanity
websites
that
permit
the
creation
of
articles
and
other
similar
venues
if
anyone
at
all
can
post
information
without
anyone
else
checking
that
information
it
is
probably
not
put
it
simply
if
there
are
reliable
sources
such
as
newspapers
journals
or
books
with
extensive
information
published
over
an
extended
period
about
a
subject
then
that
subject
is
notable
and
you
must
cite
such
sources
as
part
of
the
process
of
creating
or
expanding
the
wikipedia
article
if
you
can
not
find
such
that
provide
extensive
and
comprehensive
information
about
your
proposed
subject
then
the
subject
is
not
notable
or
verifiable
and
almost
certainly
will
be
deleted
so
your
first
job
is
to
find
to
are
many
places
to
find
reliable
sources
including
your
local
library
but
if
sources
are
to
be
used
start
with
books
and
searches
rather
than
a
web
you
have
references
for
your
article
you
can
learn
to
place
the
references
into
the
article
by
reading
for
and
do
not
worry
too
much
about
formatting
citations
properly
it
would
be
great
if
you
did
that
but
the
main
thing
is
to
references
into
the
even
if
they
are
not
perfectly
to
pages
wikipedia
is
and
common
about
yourself
your
friends
your
website
a
band
you
in
your
teacher
a
word
you
made
up
or
a
story
you
you
are
worthy
of
inclusion
in
the
encyclopedia
let
someone
else
add
an
article
for
you
putting
your
friends
in
an
encyclopedia
may
seem
like
a
nice
surprise
or
an
amusing
joke
but
articles
like
this
are
likely
to
be
removed
in
this
process
feelings
may
be
hurt
and
you
may
be
blocked
from
editing
if
you
repeatedly
make
attempts
to
the
article
these
things
can
be
avoided
by
a
little
forethought
on
your
part
the
article
may
remain
if
you
have
enough
humility
to
make
it
neutral
and
you
really
are
notable
but
even
then
it
best
to
submit
a
draft
for
approval
and
consensus
of
the
community
instead
of
just
posting
it
up
since
unconscious
biases
may
still
exist
of
which
you
may
not
be
frequently
add
pages
to

without
considering
the
topic
is
really
notable
to
go
into
an
encyclopedia
because
wikipedia
does
not
have
the
space
limitations
of
encyclopedias
our
notability
policies
and
guidelines
allow
a
wide
range
of
articles
however
they
do
not
allow
every
topic
to
be
included
a
particularly
common
special
case
of
this
is
pages
about
people
companies
or
groups
of
people
that
do
not
substantiate
the
notability
or
importance
of
their
subject
with
reliable
sources
so
we
have
decided
that
such
pages
may
be
speedily
deleted
under
our
wp
speedy
policy
this
can
offend
so
please
consider
whether
your
chosen
topic
is
notable
enough
for
wikipedia
and
then
substantiate
the
notability
or
importance
of
your
subject
by
citing
those
reliable
sources
in
the
process
of
creating
your

do
not

product

do
not
insert
external

your
commercial
website
unless
a
neutral
party
would
judge
that
the
link
truly
belongs
in
the
article
we
do
have
articles
about
products
like
kleenex
or
sharpies
or
notable
businesses
such
as
mcdonald
but
if
you
are
writing
about
a
product
or
business
be
sure
you
write
from
a
point
of
that
you
have
no
of
and
that
you
are
able
to
find
references
in

are

it

you
can
support

a
common
mistake
is
to

disambiguation

the

another
the
process

disambiguation
this

create

ask
at

for

on

the
are
three
main
ways
disambiguation
is
done
depending
on
how
many
topics
there
are
and
whether
there
one
which
is
much
more
important
than
the
for
example
when
you
enter
the
word
salsa
you
will
be
brought
to
a
page
known
as
a
that
will
list
all
the
subjects
named
salsa
including
and
several
other
meanings
of
the
word
salsa
please
only
create
disambiguation
pages
for
existing
article
clashes
not
for
prospective
in
some
cases
the
title
by
itself
will
be
used
for
the
most
common
meaning
of
the
term
the
primary
usage
and
all
other
uses
will
be
found
on
a
disambiguation
page
for
example
when
you
enter
mouse
you
will
be
brought
to
the
article
about
the
animal
all
other
uses
such
as
are
listed
on
the
disambiguation
two
or
in
some
cases
if
there
are
only
two
meanings
of
a
title
the
plain
title
will
be
used
for
one
meaning
the
more
common
one
and
a
message
on
the
top
of
that
page
known
as
a
hatnote
will
be
used
to
direct
readers
to
the
other
for
example
if
you
enter
avocado
you
will
be
brought
to
the
article
about
the
plant
a
hatnote
will
direct
you
to
a
