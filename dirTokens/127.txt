earthworm
is
a
segmented
worm
found
in
the
phylum
annelida
they
are
commonly
found
living
in
soil
feeding
on
live

dead
organic
matter
its

it
conducts

an
earthworm

it
has

the
central
nervous
system
consists
of
two

connected
to
a
nerve
cord
running
back
along

large
numbers
of
chemoreceptors
are
concentrated

a

a

the

that
run
along

pass
between

layers
of

they
give

crawling
speed
varies
both
within
and
among
individuals
earthworms
crawl
faster
primarily
by
taking
longer
strides
and
a
greater
frequency
of
strides
larger
worms
crawl
at
a
greater
absolute
speed
than
smaller
worms
they
achieve
this
by
taking
slightly
longer
strides
but
with
slightly
lower
stride
an
earthworm
stimulates
the
subepidermal
nerve
plexus
which
connects
to
the
intermuscular
plexus
and
causes
the
longitudinal
muscles
to
contract
thereby
the
writhing
movements
when
we
pick
up
an
earthworm
this
behaviour
is
a
reflex
and
does
not
require
the
cns
it
occurs
even
if
the
nerve
cord
is
removed
each
segment
of
the
earthworm
has
its
own
nerve
plexi
the
plexus
of
one
segment
is
not
connected
directly
to
that
of
adjacent
segments
the
nerve
cord
is
required
to
connect
the
nervous
systems
of
the
giant
axons
carry
the
fastest
signals
along
the
nerve
cord
these
are
emergency
signals
that
initiate
reflex
escape
behaviours
the
larger
dorsal
giant
axon
conducts
signals
the
fastest
from
the
rear
to
the
front
of
the
animal
if
the
rear
of
the
worm
is
touched
a
signal
is
rapidly
sent
forwards
causing
the
longitudinal
muscles
in
each
segment
to
contract
this
causes
the
worm
shorten
very
quickly
as
an
attempt
to
escape
from
a
predator
or
other
potential
threat
the
two
medial
giant
axons
connect
with
each
other
and
send
signals
from
the
front
to
the
rear
stimulation
of
these
causes
the
earthworm
to
very
quickly
retreat
perhaps
contracting
into
its
burrow
to
escape
a
presence
of
a
nervous
system
is
essential
for
an
animal
to
be
able
to
experience
nociception
or
pain
however
other
physiological
capacities
are
also
required
such
as
opioid
sensitivity
and
central
modulation
of
responses
by
enkephalin
and
substances
have
been
found
in
earthworms
injections
of
nalaxone
an
opioid
antagonist
inhibit
the
escape
responses
of
earthworms
this
indicates
that
opioid
substances
play
a
role
in
sensory
modulation
similar
to
that
found
in
many

not
have

although
some
worms
do
however
they
do
have
specialised
photosensitive
cells
called
light

these
photoreceptor
cells
have
a
central
intracellular
cavity
phaosome
filled
with
microvilli
as
well
as
the
microvilli
there
are
several
sensory
cilia
in
the

which
are
structurally
independent
of

the
photoreceptors
are
distributed
in
most
parts
of
the

but
are
more
concentrated
on
the

of
the

a
relatively
small

occur
on

its

the

an

increases

the

an
inner

earthworm
has
a
dual
circulatory
system
in
which
both
the
coelomic
fluid

a
closed

system
carry
the
food
waste
and
respiratory
gases
the
closed

has
five
main

the
ventral
bottom
vessel
which
runs
below

the

which
runs
below
the
ventral

cord
and
two
lateroneural
vessels
on
either
side
of
the

the
dorsal

moves
the

the
other
four
longitudinal

carry
the
blood
rearward
in
segments
six
through
a

acts
as

the

derives
from
the

several

have
the
ability
to
regenerate
lost

but
this
ability
varies
between
species
and
depends
on
the
extent
of
the
damage
stephenson
devoted
a
chapter
of
his
monograph
to
this
topic
while
gates
spent
years
studying
regeneration
in
a
variety
of
species
but
because
little
interest
was
shown
gates
only
published
a
few
of
his
findings
that
nevertheless
show
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
grow
two
whole
worms
from
a
bisected
specimen
in
certain
species
despite
denial
of
this
phenomenon
by
some
current
who
gates
reports
savigny

head
regeneration
in
an
anterior

possible
at

intersegmental
level

behind

grow

has
been
and
importance
to
close
up
of
an
earthworm
in
garden
travel
underground
by
the
means
of
waves
of
muscular
contractions
which
alternately
shorten
and
lengthen
the
body
peristalsis
the
shortened
part
is
anchored
to
the
surrounding
soil
by
tiny
bristles
setae
set
along
its
segmented
length
in
all
the
body
segments
except
the
first
last
and
clitellum
there
is
a
ring
of
setae
embedded
in
the
epidermal
pit
of
each
segment
perichaetine
the
whole
burrowing
process
is
aided
by
the
secretion
of
lubricating
mucus
worms
can
make
gurgling
noises
underground
when
disturbed
as
a
result
of
the
their
movement
through
their
lubricated
tunnels
earthworms
move
through
soil
by
expanding
crevices
with
force
when
forces
are
measured
according
to
body
weight
hatchlings
can
push
times
their
own
body
whereas
large
adults
can
push
only
times
their
own
body
work
as
biological
pistons
forcing
air
through
the
tunnels
as
they
move
thus
earthworm
activity
aerates
and
mixes
the
soil
and
is
conducive
to
mineralization
of
nutrients
and
their
uptake
by
vegetation
certain
species
of
earthworm
come
to
the
surface
and
graze
on
the
higher
concentrations
of
organic
matter
present
there
mixing
it
with
the
mineral
soil
because
a
high
level
of
organic
matter
mixing
is
associated
with
soil
fertility
an
abundance
of
earthworms
is
generally
considered
beneficial
by
the
in
fact
as
long
ago
as
wrote
it
may
be
doubted
whether
there
are
many
other
animals
which
have
played
so
important
a
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
as
have
these
lowly
organized
benefits
major
benefits
of
earthworm
activities
to
soil
fertility
can
be
summarized
biological
in
many
soils
earthworms
play
a
major
role
in
the
conversion
of
large
pieces
of
organic
matter
into
rich
humus
thus
improving
soil
fertility
this
is
achieved
by
the
worm
actions
of
pulling
below
the
surface
deposited
organic
matter
such
as
leaf
fall
or
manure
either
for
food
or
to
plug
its
burrow
once
in
the
burrow
the
worm
will
shred
the
leaf
and
partially
digest
it
and
mingle
it
with
the
earth
worm
casts
see
below
can
contain
more
humus
than
the
top
of
soil
in
which
the
worm
is
faeces
in
form
of
chemical
in
addition
to
dead
the
earthworm
also
ingests
any
other
soil
particles
that
are
small
enough
including
sand
grains
up
to
of
an
inch
mm
into
its
gizzard
wherein
those
minute
fragments
of
grit
grind
everything
into
a
fine
paste
which
is
then
digested
in
the
intestine
when
the
worm
excretes
this
in
the
form
of
casts
deposited
on
the
surface
or
deeper
in
the
soil
minerals
and
plant
nutrients
are
changed
to
an
accessible
form
for
plants
to
use
investigations
in
the
united
states
show
that
fresh
earthworm
casts
are
five
times
richer
in
available
nitrogen
seven
times
richer
in
available
phosphates
and
times
richer
in
available
potassium
than
the
surrounding
upper
of
soil
in
conditions
where
humus
is
plentiful
the
weight
of
casts
produced
may
be
greater
than
kg
per
worm
per
physical
the
earthworm
burrowing
creates
a
multitude
of
channels
through
the
soil
and
is
of
great
value
in
maintaining
the
enabling
processes
of
aeration
and
drainage
permaculture
points
out
that
by
sliding
in
their
tunnels
earthworms
act
as
an
innumerable
army
of
pistons
pumping
air
in
and
out
of
the
soils
on
a
cycle
more
rapidly
at
thus
the
earthworm
not
only
creates
passages
for
air
and
water
to
traverse
the
soil
but
also
modifies
the
vital
organic
component
that
makes
a
soil
healthy
see
bioturbation
earthworms
promote
the
formation
of
casts
globules
of
soil
stable
in

that
have
high
soil
aggregation
and
soil
fertility
and
accelerate

the
earthworm
existence
can
not
be
taken
for
granted
observed
tremendous
numerical
differences
between
adjacent
gardens
and
worm
populations
are
affected
by
a
host
of
environmental
factors
many
of
which
can
be
influenced
by
good
management
practices
on
the
part
of
the
gardener
or
estimated
that

but
more
recent
research
from
experimental
has
produced
figures
suggesting
that
even
poor
soil
may
support
acre
whilst
rich
fertile
farmland
may
have
up
to
acre
meaning
that
the

of
