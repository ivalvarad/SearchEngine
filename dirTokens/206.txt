Orthostat

orthostat
is
a
large
stone
with
a
more

slab-like
shape
that
has
been
artificially
set

block

an
orthostat

Menhirs
and
other
are
technically
orthostats
although
the
term
is
only
used
by
archaeologists
to
describe
individual
prehistoric
stones
that
constitute
part
of
larger
structures
.
Common
examples
include
the
walls
of

other
megalithic
monuments

vertical

of
