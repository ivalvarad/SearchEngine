forecourt
edit
archaeology
a
forecourt
is
the
name
given
to
the
area
in
front
of
certain
types
of
forecourts
were
probably
the
venue
for
ritual
practices
connected

forecourts
are
curved
in

with
the
entrance
to
the
tomb
at
the
apex
of
the
open
semicircle
enclosure
that
the
forecourt
creates
the
sides
were
built
up
by
either
large
upright
stones
or
walls
of
smaller
stones
laid

also
had
paved
floors

some
had
blocking
stones
erected
in
front
of
them
to
seal
the
tomb
such
as
at
kennet
long
their
shape
which
suggests
an
attempt
to
focus
attention
on
the
tomb
itself
may
mean
that
they
were
used
ceremonially
as
a
kind
of
open
air
auditorium
during
ceremonies
excavation
within
some
forecourts
has
recovered
animal
bone
pottery
and
evidence
of
burning
suggesting
that
they
served
as
locations
for
votive
offerings
or
feasting

kerb
or
peristalith
is
the
name
for
a
stone
ring
built
to
enclose
and
sometimes
revet
the
cairn
or
barrow
built
over
a
dolmens
especially
hunebed
and
dyss
burials
often
provide
examples
of
the
use
of
kerbs
in
megalithic
architecture
but
they
were
also
added
to
other
kinds
of
kerbs

be
built
in
a
stone
method
employing
small
blocks
or
more
commonly
using
larger
stones

peristalith

the
term
more
properly
used
often

been
weathered

surviving
kerb
can
give

impression
of
being
a
although
these
monuments
date
from
considerably
later
excavation
of
barrows
without
stone
rings
such
as
fussell
lodge
in
wiltshire
suggests
that
in
these
examples
timber
or
turf
was
used
to
define
a
kerb
the
the
enclosing
nature
of
kerbs
has
been
suggested
to
be
analogous
to
later
neolithic
and
stone
and
and
henges
which
also
demonstrate
an
attempt
to
demarcate
a
distinct
round
area
for
ritual
or
funerary
purposes
famous
sites
with
kerbs
include
newgrange
where
many
of
the
stones
are
etched

example
of
the
dry
stone
wall
type
of
kerb
can

at

orthostat
edit
orthostat
is
a
large
stone
with
a
more
or
less
shape
that
has
been
artificially
set
upright
so
a
block
is
not
an
orthostat
menhirs
and
other
are
technically
orthostats
although
the
term
is
only
used
by
archaeologists
to
describe
individual
prehistoric
stones
that
constitute
part
of
larger
structures
common
examples
include
the
walls
of
and
other
megalithic
monuments
and
the
vertical
elements
of
the
trilithons
at
stonehenge
especially
later
othostats
