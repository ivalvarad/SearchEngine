the
economic
boom
precipitated
by
trade
between
the
east
indies
and
china

the
number
of
ethnic

in
batavia
grew
rapidly
reaching
a
total
of

thousands
more

the
dutch
colonials
required
them
to
carry

deported

policy
was
tightened
during

after
an
outbreak
of
malaria
killed
thousands
including
the
of
the
dutch
east
van
according
to
indonesian
historian
the
outbreak
was
followed
by
increased
suspicion
and
resentment
in
native
indonesians
and
the
dutch
toward
the
ethnic
chinese
who
were
growing
in
number
and
whose

was
increasingly

in

the
deportation

time
native
occupants
of
batavia
including
the
ethnic
betawi
servants
became
increasingly
distrustful
of
the
chinese
economic
factors
played
a
role
most
natives
were
poor
and
perceived
the
chinese
as
occupying
some
of
the
most
prosperous

in

the
dutch
historian
paasman
notes
that
at
the
time
the
chinese
were
the
jews
of
the
actual
situation
was
more
complicated
many
poor
chinese
living
in

the
distillation
of

molasses
and
alcoholic
however
the
dutch
overlords
set
the
price
for
sugar

itself
caused
because
of
the
decline
of
worldwide
sugar
prices
that
began

increase
in

that
led

a
dichotomy

in

the
massacre
may
also
have
been
a
factor
in
the
naming

numerous
areas
in
jakarta
one
possible
etymology
for
the
name
of
the
tanah
abang
district
meaning
red
earth
is
that
it
was
named
for
the
chinese
blood
spilled
there
van

that
the
naming
was
a
compromise
to
make

the
name
for
a
subdistrict
of
east
jakarta
may
be
derived
from
the
vulgar
indonesian
word
for
corpse
bangkai
due
to
the
great
number
of
ethnic
chinese
killed

a
similar
etymology
