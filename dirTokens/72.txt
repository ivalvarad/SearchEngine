with

and
to

Two
days
later
,
rumours
of
Chinese
atrocities
led
other
Batavian
ethnic
groups
to
burn
Chinese
houses
along
Besar

and
Dutch
soldiers
to
fire

at
Chinese
homes
.
The
violence
soon
spread
throughout
Batavia

killing
more
Chinese
.
Although
Valckenier
declared
an
amnesty
on
11October
,
gangs
of
irregulars
continued
to
hunt
and
kill
Chinese
until
22October
,
when
the
governor-general
called
more
forcefully
for
a
cessation
of

Outside

clashes
continued
between
Dutch
troops
and

of

The

precipitated
by
trade
between

East

and
China
via

of

increased
Chinese

The
number
of

in

grew
rapidly

he
was
unable
to
attract

of

thus
sold

One

is
that

be
derived
