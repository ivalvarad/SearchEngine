the

critics
argue
that
the
prestige
of
the
prize
in
economics
derives
in
part
from
its
association
with
the
nobel
prizes
an
association
that
has
often
been
a
source
of
controversy
among
them
is
the
swedish
human
rights
lawyer
a
of
nobel
criticizes
the
awarding
institution
of
misusing
his
family
name
and
states
that
no
member
of
the
nobel
family
has
ever
had
the
intention
of
establishing
a
prize
in
to
of
the
both
of
the
former
swedish
ministers
of
finance
and
wanted
the
prize
abolished
saying
myrdal
rather
less
graciously
wanted
the
prize
abolished
because
it
had
been
given
to
such
reactionaries
as
hayek
and
afterwards
milton
his
speech
at
the
nobel
prize
banquet
stated
that
had
he
been
consulted
on
the
establishment
of
a
nobel
prize
in
economics
he
would
have
decidedly
advised
against
primarily
because
the
nobel
prize
confers
on
an
individual
an
authority
which
in
economics
no
man
ought
to
possess
this
does
not
matter
in
the
natural
sciences
here
the
influence
exercised
by
an
individual
is
chiefly
an
influence
on
his
fellow
experts
and
they
will
soon
cut
him
down
to
size
if
he
exceeds
his
competence
but
the
influence
of
the
economist
that
mainly
matters
is
an
influence
over
laymen
politicians
journalists
civil
servants
and
the
public
cite
the
apparent
snub
of

evidence
of

friedman

accused
of
supporting
the
military
dictatorship
in
chile
because
of
the
relation
of
economists
