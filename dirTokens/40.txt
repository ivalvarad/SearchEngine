the
RPG-7

is
one
of
the
most
popular
infantry
anti-tank
and
general
support
weapons
in
the
world
.
It
is
robust
,
cheap
,
easy
to
operate
and
effective
.
From
Afghanistan
to
Somalia
from
Chechnya
to
Angola
the
weapon
is
well
liked
by
many
infantrymen
and
guerrillas
around
the
origin
of
the
RPG
can
be
traced
back
to
the
World
War
II
German
Panzerfaust
based
on
which
the
Soviets
have
developed
a
range
of
grenade
launchers
.
Among
these
the
most
successful
design
is
the
RPG-7
,
which
was
first
fielded
by
the
Soviet
in
1961
.
Since
then
,
the
