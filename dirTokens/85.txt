Dell
did
not

the
consumer
market
,
due
to
the
higher
costs
and
unacceptably
low
profit
margins
in
selling
to
individuals
and
households
;
this
changed
when
the
company
's
Internet
site
took
off
in
1996
and
1997
.
While
the
industry
's
average
selling
price
to
individuals
was
going
down
,
Dell
's
was
going
up
,
as
second

third-time
computer
buyers
who
wanted
powerful
computers
with
multiple
features
and
did
not
need
much
technical
support
were
choosing
Dell
.
Dell
found
an
opportunity
among
PC-savvy
individuals
who
liked
the
convenience
of
buying
direct
,
customizing
their
PC
to
their
means
,
and
having
it
delivered
in

.
In

Operating

the
mid-1990s
,
Dell
expanded
beyond
desktop
computers
and

by
selling
servers

starting
with
low-end
servers

The
major
three
providers
of
servers
at
the
time
were
IBM
,
Hewlett

,
and
Compaq
,
many
of
which
were
based
on
proprietary
technology
,
such
as
IBM
's
Power4
microprocessors
or
various
proprietary
versions
of
the
Unix
operating
system
.
Dell
's
new
PowerEdge
servers
did
not
require
a
major
investment
in
proprietary
technologies
,
as
they
ran
Windows
on
Intel

Consequently

percent
of

company

Dell
passed
Compaq

of

percent
of
the

occurred
in

needed
to
make
inroads
into

segments
such
as

Dell

price
advantage
was
tied
to
its
ultra-lean
manufacturing
for

-LSB-

but
this
became
less
important
as
savings
became

as

Throughout
the

declines
in

increases
in
