the

,
software
vendors
began
to
produce
prepackaged
enterprise
portals
.
These
software
packages
would
be
toolkits
for
enterprises
to
quickly
develop
and
deploy
their
own
customized
enterprise
portal
.
The
first
commercial
portal
software
vendor
began
to
appear
in
1998
.
Pioneers
in
this

included
``

vendors
like
Epicentric
and
Viador
.
The
space
,
however
,
quickly
became
crowded
by

with
the
entry
into
the
market
of
competing
product

from
vendors

such
as

In
2003
,
vendors
of

enterprise

produced
a
standard
known
as
JSR-168
It
was
to
specify
an
API
for
interoperability
between
enterprise
portals
and
portlets
.
Software
vendors
began
producing
JSR-168
compliant
portlets
that
can
be
deployed
onto
any
JSR-168
compliant
enterprise
portal
.
The
second
iteration
of
the
standard

JSR-286

final-released

2009
,
Gartner
introduced
the
concept
of
the
portal-less
portal
or
the
``
lean
portal
''
.
Lean
Portals
offer
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
portals
available
for
the
last
15
years
,
which
have
become
very
difficult
to
deploy
and
maintain
.
Traditional
portals
are
bloated
with
features
that
are
n't
necessarily
cost-effective
to
businesses
.
This
leads
to
a
lot
of
frustration
for
companies
thinking
of
investing
in
a
portal
as
the
traditional
model
forces
them
to
exceed
their
budgets
for
features
they
do
n't
want
or
need
,
without
being
able
to
deliver
the
results
they
wanted
.
In
contrast
,
a
Lean
Portal
is
lightweight
and
easy
to
deploy
.
It
's
built
using
modern
Web
2.0
technologies
,
such
as
AJAX
,
widgets
,
representational
state
transfer
-LRB-
REST
-RRB-
and
WOA/SOA
approaches
.
Lean
Portal
offerings
from
vendors
like
Backbase
and
Liferay
replace
the
traditional
container-oriented
portal
model
while
maintaining
the
main
purpose
of
a
portal
--
providing
a
personalized
point
of
access
that
allows
customers
to
find
relevant
information
,
read
about
business
processes
and
reach
people
.
According
to
Gartner
organizations
who
opted
for
a
Lean
Portal
found
that
it
delivered
more
than
80
%
of
the
required
functionality
within
months
of
launching
,
without
compromising
security
or

Personalization
--
Personalization
is
more
about
matching
content
with
the
user
.
Based
on
a
user
profile
,
personalization
uses
rules
to
match
the
``
services
''
,
or
content
,
to
the
specific
user
.
To
some
degree
,
you
can
think
of
the
two
like
this
:
customization
is
in
hands
of
the
end
user
,
personalization
is
not
.
Of
course
actual
personalization
is
often
based
on
your
role
or
job
function
within
the
portal
--
the
ability
for
portal
to
limit
specific
types
of
content
and
services
users
have
access
to
.
For
example
,
a
company
's
proprietary
information
can
be
entitled
for
only
company
employee
access
.
This
access
rights
may
be
provided
by
a

administrator

by
a
