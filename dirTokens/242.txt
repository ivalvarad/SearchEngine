hallmark
of
enterprise
portals
is
the
content
contribution
and
which
keeps
the

always

another
distinguishing
characteristic
is
that
they
cater

of

and

that
were
often
presented
in

portlets
before
long
enterprises
of
all

began
to
see
a
need
for
a
similar
starting
place
for
their
variety
of
internal
repositories
and
applications
many
of
which
were
migrating
to
the
late
software
vendors
began
to
produce
prepackaged
enterprise
portals
these
software
packages
would
be
toolkits
for
enterprises
to
quickly
develop
and
deploy
their
own
customized
enterprise
portal
the
first
commercial

software
vendor
began
to
appear
in
pioneers
in
this
marketing
included
pure

vendors
like
epicentric
and
viador
the
space
however
quickly
became
crowded
by
with
the
entry
into
the
market
of
competing
product
offerings
from
vendors
such
as
bea
ibm
banc
intranets
and
who
saw
portals
as
an
opportunity
to
stave
off
the
commoditization
of
application
server
technology

enterprise

produced
a
standard
known
as
it

to
specify

for
interoperability
between
enterprise
portals
and

software
vendors
began
producing

portlets
that
can
be
deployed
onto
any
compliant
enterprise

the

introduced
the
concept
of
the
portal
or
the
lean
portal
lean
portals
offer
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
portals
available
for
the
last
years
which
have
become
very
difficult
to
deploy
and
maintain
traditional
portals
are
bloated
with
features
that
are
necessarily
to
businesses
this
leads
to
a
lot
of
frustration
for
companies
thinking
of
investing
in
a
portal
as
the
traditional
model
forces
them
to
exceed
their
budgets
for
features
they
do
want
or
need
without
being
able
to
deliver
the
results
they
wanted
in
contrast
a
lean
portal
is
lightweight
and
easy
to
deploy
it
built
using
modern
web
technologies
such
as
ajax
widgets
representational
state
transfer
rest
and
approaches
lean
portal
offerings
from
vendors
like
backbase
and
liferay
replace
the
traditional
portal
model
while
maintaining
the
main
purpose
of
a
portal
providing
a
personalized
point
of
access
that
allows
customers
to
find
relevant
information
read
about
business
processes
and
reach
people
according
to
gartner
organizations
who
opted
for
a
lean
portal
found
that
it
delivered
more
than
of
the
required
functionality
within
months
of
launching
without
compromising
security
or
advanced
integration
edit
enterprise
portal
has
two
main
functions
integration
and
it
must
be
able
to
access
information
from
multiple
and
varied
sources
and
manipulate
that
information
through
the
common
features
enterprise
portals
can
provide
capabilities
between
their
users
and
various
other
systems
this
requires
a
user
to
authenticate
only
integration
the
connection
of
functions
and
data
from
multiple
systems
into
new
portlets
with
an
integrated
navigation
between
these
federation
the
integration
of
content
provided
by
other
portals
typically
through
the
use
of
wsrp
or
similar
customization
users
can
customize
the
look
and
feel
of
their
environment
customers
who
are
using
eips
can
edit
and
design
their
own
web
sites
which
are
full
of
their
own
personality
and
own
style
they
can
also
choose
the
specific
content
and
services
they
prefer
also
refers
to
the
ability
to
prioritize
most
appropriate
content
based
on
attributes
of
the
user
and
metadata
of
the
available
personalization
personalization
is
more
about
matching
content
with
the
user
based
on
a
user
profile
personalization
uses
rules
to
match
the
services
or
content
to
the
specific
user
to
some
degree
you
can
think
of
the
two
like
this
customization
is
in
hands
of
the
end
user
personalization
is
not
of
course
actual
personalization
is
often
based
on
your
role
or
job
function
within
the
portal
the
ability
for

to

specific
types
