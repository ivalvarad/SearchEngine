it

and

technologies
significantly
affect
human
as
well
as
other
animal
species
ability
to

and

to
their
natural
environments
the
word
technology
comes
from
greek
from
meaning
art
skill
craft
and
meaning
study
of
the
term
can
be
applied
either
generally
or
to
many
specific
areas
examples
of
which
include
and
human
species
use
of
technology
began
with
the
conversion
of
natural
resources
into
simple
tools
the
prehistorical
discovery
of
the
ability
to
control
fire
increased
the
available
sources
of
food
and
the
invention
of
the
wheel
helped
humans
in
travelling
in
and
controlling
their
environment
recent
technological
developments
including
the
the
telephone
and
the
internet
have
lessened
physical
barriers
to
communication
and
allowed
humans
to
interact
freely
on
a
global
scale
however
not
all
technology
has
been
used
for
peaceful
purposes
the
development
of
weapons
of
destructive
power
has
progressed
throughout
history
from
clubs
to
has
affected
society
and
its
surroundings
in
a
number
of
ways
in
many
societies
technology
has
helped
develop
more
advanced
economies
including
today
and
has
allowed
the
rise
of
a
leisure
class
many
technological
processes
produce
unwanted
known
as
pollution
and
deplete
natural
resources
to
the
detriment
of
the
earth
and
its
environment
various
implementations
of
technology
influence
the
values
of
a
society
and
new
technology
often
raises
new
ethical
questions
examples
include
the
rise
of
the
notion
of
efficiency
in
terms
of
human
productivity
a
term
originally
applied
only
to
machines
and
the
challenge
of
traditional
debates
have
arisen
over
the
present
and
future
use
of
technology
in
society
with
disagreements
over
whether
technology
improves
the
or
worsens
it
and
similar
movements
criticise
the
pervasiveness
of
technology
in
the
modern
world
opining
that
it
harms
the
environment
and
alienates
people
proponents
of
ideologies
such
as
transhumanism
and
view
continued
technological
progress
as
beneficial
to
society
and
the
human
condition
indeed
until
recently
it
was
believed
that
the
development
of
technology
was
restricted
only
to
human
beings
but
recent
scientific
studies
indicate
that
other
primates
and
certain
dolphin
communities
have
developed
simple
tools
and
learned
to
pass
their
knowledge
