are
tree
dwelling
primates
and
are
capable
of
leaping
great
distances
,
using
flattened
disks
on
their
feet
and
hands
as
a
way
of
grasping
branches
.
However
they
do
walk
on
the
ground
sometimes

either
bipedally
or
on

Galagos
are
solitary
foragers

however
they
do
meet
up
at
night
in
groups
,
and
sleep
during
the
day
in
groups

around
6

Calls
are
a
big
part
of
Galago
life
and
there
are
up
to
18
distinct
calls
.
All
these
calls
are
part
of
three
categories
,
defensive
and
aggressive
,
social
contact
and
annuciatory
.
