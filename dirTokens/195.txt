species
or
are
strepsirrhine
primates
of
the
genus
galago
they
are
classified
along
with
the
bushbabies
genus
euoticus
and
the
rest
of
the
galagos
genus
otolemur
in
the
family
galagidae
they
are
probably
the
most
numerous
primate
in
africa
and
can
be
found
in
every
large
forest
on
the
continent
galagos
also
prefer
savannahs
woodlands
riverine
bush
and
the
fringes
of
forests
they
mark
their
territory
by
urinating
on
their
hands
and
leaving
traces
on
the
trees
they
climb
across
and
they
follow
these
detectable
paths
through
the
trees
night

males
will
also
urinate
on
females

them
they
are
related
to
lorises
and
have
similar

breeding
edit
bushbabies
usually
give
birth
during
the
rainy
season
the
offspring
are
usually
after
the
birth
there
is
usually
a
second
period
of
heat
a
female
gestation
period
is
between
days
and
will
usually
consist
of
the
female
mating
with
up
to
different
bushbaby
mothers
initially
shelter
their
offspring
in
a
nest
or
tree
hollow
later
on
concealing
the
infants
in
foliage
while
they
forage
at
in
some
species
such
as
group
the
nests
may
be
shared
by
groups
of
females
or
occasionally
by
visiting
diet

generally
consume
insects
and
gums
however

are
brown
grey
to
light
grey
in
color
with
many
showing
a

tint
to
the
sides
and

they
also
have
a
distinct
dark
marking
around
the
behavior
edit
are
tree
dwelling
primates
and
are
capable
of
leaping
great
distances
using
flattened
disks
on
their
feet
and
hands
as
a
way
of
grasping
branches
however
they
do
walk
on
the
ground
sometimes
either
bipedally
or
on
all
fours
galagos
are
solitary
foragers
however
they
do
meet
up
at
night
in
groups
and
sleep
during
the
day
in
groups
of
around
calls
are
a
big
part
of
galago
life
and
there
are
up
to
distinct
calls
all
these
calls
are
part
of
three
categories
defensive
and
aggressive
social
contact
and
annuciatory
they
also
have
a
very
highly
