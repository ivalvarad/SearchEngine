is

three
the
starter
level
sets
the
original
portal
was
released
on
may
followed
by
second
on
june
and
three
on
july
the
portal
set
was
inspired
by
chinese
mythology
in

by
chinese
historical
novel
of

portal
was
of
the
first
major
attempt
at
a
set
that
new
players
could
come
into
the
game
and
understand
back
before
the
major
rules
changes
brought
forth
by
magic
rules
were
more
complicated
today
they
are
simplified
with
the
addition
of
the
stack
the
three
portal
sets
attempted
to
mitigate
the
of
october
update
all
cards
portal
second
and
three
are
legal
in
vintage
and
legacy
tournaments
edit
three
was
released
mainly
in
markets
these
cards
were
printed
in
japanese
and
a
very
short
english
printing
run
was
done
but
these
versions
of
the
cards
were
released
primarily
in
australia
and
new
zealand
and
are
relatively
difficult
to
find
with
prices
amongst
the
highest
in
any
set
each
card
including
each
basic
land
was
illustrated
by
a
chinese
artist
as
referenced
and
based
on
actual
history
this
set
was
also
the
only
set
not
based
on
multiverse
nor
planes
the
main
universe
in
the
magic
the
october
the
dci
legalized
cards
from
the
portal
expansions
now
almost
all
cards
in
the
portal
block
are
legal
in
vintage
and
legacy
tournaments
allowing
this
set
to
be
played
in
tournaments
had
the
effect
of
making
many
cards
from
this
set
very
expensive
such
as
of
and
of
the
value
of
those
cards
now
often
exceeds
a
piece
with
its
most
card
commanding
well
over
many
cards
from
this
set
are
now
worth
more
than
making
the
sealed
booster
box
from
this
set
one
of
the
most
expensive
along
with
alpha
beta
and
unlimited
in
a
tournament
context
like
all
other
portal
sets
can
only
be
used
in
vintage
and
legacy
formats
where
many
decks
function
with
limited
or
no
creature
base
is
also
legal
in
the
commander
mechanics
edit
new
mechanics
were
introduced
with
portal
but
there
were
several
simplifications
made
to
the
game
through
things
left
out
of
the
set
instants
did
not
exist
within
the
set
instead
every
spell
was
a
sorcery
however
some
sorceries
could
be
played
at
particular
times
uncommon
to
sorceries
but
normal
for
instants
most
of
these
cards
have
since
received
errata
making
them
instants
all
rules
text
was
in
boldface
all
flavor
text
and
reminder
italicized
text
was
not
boldface
to
separate
rules
text
and
flavor
text
the
cards
utilized
a
line
with
a
slight
bulge
on
both
top
and
bottom
this
makes
the
line
look
like
a
very
elongated
diamond
rather
than
using
the
words
block
graveyard
and
library
portal
used
the
words
intercept
discard
pile
and
deck
portal
cards
had
no
creature
also
did
not
have
instants
though
a
number
of
sorceries
in
the
set
have
later
errata
making
them
clarify
it
also
carried
over
the
different
style
for

text
second
cards
dispensed
with
the
summon
wording
for
creature
spells
and
were
the
first
to
word
them
as
creature
type
that
was
adopted
with
in
block
remained
as
it
was
replacing
intercept
from
portal
similarly
graveyard
discard
pile
and
library
three
is
the
only
starter
level
set
to
introduce
a
new
keyword
ability
into
the
game
horsemanship
an
evasion
ability
that
works
like
flying
in
that
creatures
with
horsemanship
can
be
blocked
only
by
creatures
with
horsemanship
creatures
with
horsemanship
can
block
creatures
without
horsemanship
as
well
but
not
be
blocked
by
creatures
with
flying
likewise
horsemanship
creatures
can
not
block
flying
creatures
as
such
these
creatures
are
effectively
unblockable
by
almost
all
other
creatures
there
was
controversy
when
the
set
became
tournament
legal
as
some
players
thought
that
cards
with
the
horsemanship
ability
should
be
errata
to
have
flying
instead
wizards
of
the
coast
initially
considered
making
this
change
but
decided
against
it
stating
that
the
creatures
with
horsemanship
are
rare
and
not
aggressive
enough
to
make
an
impact
on
vintage
formats
horsemanship
has
become
an
obscure
ability
due
to
the
limited
production
and
geographical
release
of
the
set
and
wizards
have
stated
that
it
will
be
unlikely
that
horsemanship
will
return
on
new
cards
in
the
future
with
the
release
of
wizards
returned
a
vast
number
of
older

horsemanship
