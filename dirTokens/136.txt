Albinism

Albinism
in
birds
is
rare
,
occurring
to
any
extent
in
perhaps
one
in
1800
individuals
.
It
involves
loss
of
colour
in
all
parts
including
the
iris
of
the
eyes
,
bills
,
skin
,
legs
,
and
feet
.
It
is
usually
the
result
of
a
genetic
mutation
causing
the
absence
of
tyrosinase
an
enzyme
essential
for
melanin
synthesis
.
Leucism
-LRB-
which
includes
what
used
to
be
termed
as
``
partial

-RRB-
refers
to
loss
