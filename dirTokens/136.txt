some
duck
species
remain

are
hereditary
as
well
as
variations
in
plumage
that
are
rare

termed
as
abnormal

aberrant
plumages
melanism
refers
to
an
excess
of
black

dark
colours
erythromelanism
or
erythrism
is
the
result
of
excessive
reddish
brown
erythromelanin
deposition
in
feathers
that
normally
lack
melanin
melanin
of
different
forms
combine
with
xanthophylls
to
produce
colour
mixtures
and
when
this
combination
is
imbalanced
it
produces
colour
shifts
that
are
termed
as
schizochroisms
including
xanthochromism
overabundance
of
yellow
and
axanthism
lack
of
yellow
which
are
commonly
bred
in
cagebirds
such
as
budgerigars
a
reduction
in
eumelanin
leads
to
schizochroism
with
an
overall
fawn
plumage
while
a
lack
of
phaeomelanin
results
in
grey
coloured
schizochroism
carotenism

abnormal
distribution
of
carotenoid
term
dilution
is
used
for
situations
where
the
colour
is
of
a
lower
intensity
overall
it
is
caused
by
decreased
deposition
of
pigment
in
the

thus

there

polymorphism
this
means
that
two

most
seasons

plumages
in

a
brown
phaeomelanin

exist
termed

other
cases

albinism
edit
albinism
in
birds
is
rare
occurring
to
any
extent
in
perhaps
one
in
individuals
it
involves
loss
of
colour
in
all
parts
including
the
iris
of
the
eyes
bills
skin
legs
and
feet
it
is
usually
the
result
of
a
genetic
mutation
causing
the
absence
of
tyrosinase
an
enzyme
essential
for
melanin
synthesis
leucism
which
includes
what
used
to
be
termed
as
partial
albinism
refers
to
loss
of
pigments
in
some
or
all
parts
of
feathers

not
an
albino

a
bird
that
has
seasonally
alternating

degrees
of
albinism
have
been
described
the
most
common
form
is
termed
in
which
local
areas
of
the
bird
body
such
as
certain
feathers
are
lacking
the

the

in
the
irises
the
beak
legs

are
very
pale

albino
adults
are
rare
in
the
wild
because
their
eyesight
is
poor
resulting
in
greater
risk
of
they
are
likely
easier
targets
for
predators
because
their
colour
distinguishes
them
from

falconers
have
observed
that
their
trained
birds
are
likely
to
attack
a
white
pigeon
in
a
flock
because
it
is
conspicuous
a
complete
albino
often
has
weak
eyesight
and
brittle
wing
and
tail
feathers
which
may
reduce
its
ability
to
