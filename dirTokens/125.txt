an
arrangement
of
fruits
commonly
thought

as
vegetables
including

is
an
important
feature
of
some
fruits
of

commercial
cultivars
of
bananas
and
pineapples
are
examples
of
some
cultivars
of
citrus
fruits
especially
navel
oranges
satsumas
grapefruit
and
watermelons
are
valued
for
their
seedlessness
in
some
species
seedlessness
is
the
result
of
parthenocarpy
where
fruits
set
without
fertilization
parthenocarpic
fruit
set
may
or
may
not
require
pollination
but
most
seedless
citrus
fruits
require
stimulus
from
pollination
to
produce
bananas
and
grapes
are
triploids
and
seedlessness
results
from
the
abortion
of
the
embryonic
plant
that
is
produced
by
fertilization
a
phenomenon
known
as
stenospermocarpy
which
requires
normal
pollination
and
in
fruit
structures
largely
depend
on
the
of
of
the
seeds
they
contain
this
dispersal
can
be
achieved
by
animals
wind
water
or
grapes
and
fruits
have
coats
covered
with
spikes
or
hooked
burrs
either
to
prevent
themselves
from
being
eaten
by
animals
or
to
stick
to
the
hairs
feathers
or
legs
of
animals
using
them
as
dispersal
agents
examples
include
cocklebur
and
sweet
flesh
of
many
fruits
is
deliberately
appealing
to
animals
so
that
the
seeds
held
within
are
eaten
and
unwittingly
carried
away
and
deposited
defecated
at
a
distance
from
the
parent
likewise
the
nutritious
oily
kernels
of
nuts
are
appealing
to
rodents
such
as
squirrels
who
hoard
them
in
the
soil
in
order
to
avoid
starving
during
the
winter
thus
giving
those
seeds
that
remain
uneaten
the
chance
to
germinate
and

elongated

flattened

naturally
and
so
become
thin
