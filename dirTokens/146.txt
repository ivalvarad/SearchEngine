common
blackbird
was
described
by
linnaeus
in
the
edition
of
his
in
as
characterised
as
ater
rostro
palpebrisque
the
binomial
name
derives
from
two
latin
words
turdus
thrush
and
merula
blackbird
the
latter
giving
rise
to
its
french
name
merle
and
its
scots
name
merl

species

southwest
pacific
which
probably
diverged
from

fairly
may
not
immediately
be

the

western
palaearctic
populations

generally
stable

but
there
have
been
local
declines
especially
on
farmland
which
may
be
due
to
agricultural
policies
that
encouraged
farmers
to
remove
hedgerows
which
provide
nesting
places
and
to
drain
damp
grassland
and
increase
the
use
of
pesticides

common
blackbird
was
introduced
to
australia
by
a
bird
dealer
visiting
melbourne
in
early
and
its
range
has
expanded
from
its
initial
foothold
in
melbourne
and
adelaide
to
include
all
of
australia
including
tasmania
and
the
the
introduced
population
in

is
considered
a
pest
because
it
damages
a
variety
of
soft
fruits
in
orchards
parks
and
gardens
including
berries
cherries
stone
fruit

thought
to
spread
weeds
such
as
blackberry

native
birds

a
song
for
cover
common
blackbird
was
seen
as
a
sacred
though
destructive
bird
in
classical
greek
folklore
and
was
said
to
die
if
it
consumed
pomegranate
like
many
other
small
birds
it
has
in
the
past
been
trapped
in
rural
areas
at
its
night
roosts
as
an
easily
available
addition
to
the
and
in
medieval
times
the
conceit
of
placing
live
birds
under
a
pie
crust
just
before
serving
may
have
been
the
origin
of
the
familiar

song
of
a
pocket
full
of
four
and
twenty
blackbirds
baked
in
