The
binomial
name
derives
from
two
Latin
words
,
turdus
``
thrush
''
,
and
merula
``
blackbird
''
,
the
latter
giving
rise
to
its
French
name

and
its

About

may
not
immediately
be
clear
why
the
name
``
blackbird
''
,
first
recorded
in
1486
,
was
applied
to
this
species
,
but
not
to
one
of
the
various
other
common
black
English
birds
,
such
as
the

or
jackdaw
However
,
in

in
up
to
about
the
18th
century
,
``

''
was
used
only
for
smaller
or
young
birds
,
and
larger
ones
such
as
crows
were
called
``
