portal
is
an
opening
in
the
walls
of
a

fortification
and
especially
a
grand
entrance
to
an
important
structure
doors
metal
gates
or
portcullis
in
the

can
be
used
to
control
entry
or
exit
the
surface
surrounding
the
opening
may
be
made
of
simple
building
materials
or
decorated
with

elements
of
a

can
include
the
voussoir
tympanum
an
ornamented
mullion
or
trumeau
between
doors
and
columns
with
carvings

allow
rapid
travel
between
distant
locations
often
originating
from
some
combination
of
natural
phenomenon
and
technological
device
these
fictional
devices
are
required
for
most
stories
on
an
scale
otherwise
transit
time
would
be
excessive
for
storytelling
purposes
an
advantage
of
portal
technology
over
a
is
that
it
can
be
imagined
to
work
instantly
and
can
to
the
past
or
in
other
forms
of
fiction
a
portal
may
be

area

to
several
sectors
these
sectors
would
be
then
connected
to
each
other
by
small
openings
such
as
doors
or
windows
these
openings
are
referred
as
portals
when
the
sector
behind
a
portal
needs
to
be
drawn
the
only
parts
that
are
visible
are
the
parts
that
can
be
seen
through
the
portal
therefore
the
sector
can
be
clipped

use
of
portals

the
task
of
determining
visible
areas
and
objects
from
any
given
point
of

and
simplifies
rendering
