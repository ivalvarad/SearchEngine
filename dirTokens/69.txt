represented
a
substantial

the

the
as

the

world
is
considered
to
be
unipolar
with

the

the

defined
the

of

after

during

was
estimated
at
nearly

in

and
although
soviet
casualties
are
difficult
to
estimate
as
a
share
of
their
gross
national
product
the
financial
cost
for
the
soviet

was
much
higher
than
that
incurred
by
the

in

after

however
is

of

and
social
tensions
that
were
exploited
to
fuel

competition
in
parts
of

remain
acute
the
breakdown

in

cold

endures
as
a
popular
topic
reflected
extensively
in

continuing

of

soon
as
the
term
cold
war
was
popularized
to
refer
to
tensions
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
interpreting
the
course
and
origins
of
the
conflict
has
been
a
source
of
heated
controversy
among
historians
political
scientists
and
in
particular
historians
have
sharply
disagreed
as
to
who
was
responsible
for
the
breakdown
of
soviet
us
relations
after
the
second
world
war
and
whether
the
conflict
between
the
two
superpowers
was
inevitable
or
could
have
been
historians
have
also
disagreed
on
what
exactly
the
cold
war
was
what
the
sources
of
the
conflict
were
and
how
to
disentangle
patterns
of
action
and
reaction
between
the
two
explanations
of
the
origins
of
the
conflict
in
academic
discussions
are
complex
and
diverse
several
general
schools
of
thought
on
the
subject
can
be
identified
historians
commonly
speak
of
three
differing
approaches
to
the
study
of
the
cold
war
orthodox
accounts
revisionism
and
accounts
place
responsibility
for
the
cold
war
on
the
soviet
union
and
its
expansion
further
into
revisionist
writers
place
more
responsibility
for
the
breakdown
of
peace
on
the
united
states
citing
a
range
of
us
efforts
to
isolate
and
confront
the
soviet
union
well
before
the
end
of
world
war
see
the
events
of
the

as
more
nuanced
and
