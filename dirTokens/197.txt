a

of

the
also
mediawiki
groups
accented
characters
separately
from
their
unaccented
version
so
pages
starting

be
listed
under
separate
headings
instead
of
under

at
special
allpages
and
special

a

treated
as
a

coming
before
all
other

not
as
an
page
whose
title
begins
with
a
number
will
be
grouped
only
according
to
the
first
number
thus
dog
dogs
and
dogs
all
appear
under
the

not

this
will
cause

this
also
means
that

if

a

recent

pages

for

to
find

which

then

it
is
not
possible
to
detect

their

no
