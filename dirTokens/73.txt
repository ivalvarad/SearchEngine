Paris
'
Roman
era
,
its
main
cemetery
was
located
to
the
outskirts
of
the
Left
Bank
settlement
,
but
this
changed
with
the
rise
of
Catholicism
,
where
most
every
inner-city
church
had
adjoining
burial
grounds
for
use
by
their
parishes
.
With
Paris
'
growth
many
of
these
,
particularly
the
city
's
largest
cemetery
,
were
filled
to
overflowing
,
creating
quite
unsanitary
conditions
for
the
capital
.
When
inner-city
burials
were
condemned
from
1786
,
the
contents
of
all
Paris
'
parish
cemeteries
were
transferred
to
a
renovated
section

After
a
tentative
creation
of
several
smaller
suburban
cemeteries
,
the
Prefect
Nicholas
Frochot
under
provided
a
more
definitive
solution
in
the
creation
of
three
massive
Parisian
cemeteries
outside

Open
from
1804
,
these
were
the
cemeteries
of
Montmartre
Montparnasse
and
later
Passy
these
cemeteries
became
inner-city
once
again
when
Paris
annexed
all
neighbouring
communes
to
the
inside
of
its
much
larger
ring
of
suburban
fortifications
in
1860
.
New
