of

by
March
1877
consisted
of
a
wooden
box
which
looked
pretty
much
like
a
photographer
's
camera
.
The
mouthpiece
was
a
two-inch
tube
that
had
an
opening
into
a
cavern
air
chamber
that
had
in
the
back
a
4.5
inch
round
plate
of
sheet
iron
.
This
box
telephone
consisted
a
large
``
U
''
shaped
magnet
with
an
iron
core
attached
to
each
pole
.
The
soft
iron
core
attachments
were
spun
with
a
spool
of
small
gauge
insulated
wire
.
The
electrical
current
generated
by
the
spools
of
wire
related
to
a
person
's
voice
talked
into
the
mouthpiece
.
The
whole
mechanical
gadget
was
bulky
and
awkward
.

The

be
held

experiments
had
been
taking
place
at
Brown
University
in
Providence
since
the
fall
of
1876
.
The
professors
doing
these
experiments
were
Peirce
,
Francis
and
Whitney
Blake
,
By
April
1877
they
constructed
the
first
portable
telephone
.
This
was
made
of
two
blocks
of
wood
.
One
block
of
wood
had
a
hole
in
it
for
the
two
inch
round
converging
mouthpiece
designed
by

The
other
block
of
wood
supported
a
``
U
''
shaped
magnet
.
This
``
U
''
magnet
was
made
of
two
toy
magnets
.
It
had
a
sheet
metal
plate
on
top
to
pick
up
voice
sounds
that
was
just
touching
an
iron
rod
with
a
spool
of
small
gauge
insulated
wire
.
The
electrical
currents
generated
by
the
spool
of
wire
related
to
a

telephone
device
weighed
about
twelve
ounces
.
It
was
held
by
the
hand
when
constructed
on
a
handle
.
It
reproduced
voices
better
that
the
large
box
telephones
made
earlier
.
It
worked
well
over
long
circuits
but
with
less
volume
.
The
handle
telephone
was
embraced
by
Graham
and
in
June
1878
the
Telephone
started
production
as
its
standard
model
to
sell
internationally
