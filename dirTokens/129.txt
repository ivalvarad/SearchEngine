Melatonin

his
book
Birds
David
Rothernberg
claims
that
birds
vocalize
traditional
scales
used
in
human
music
,
such
as
the
pentatonic
scale
-LRB-
e.g.
,
and
diatonic
scale
-LRB-
e.g.
,
providing
evidence
that
birdsong
not
only
sounds
like
music
,
but
is
music
in
the
human
sense
.
This
claim
has
been
refuted
by
Sotorrio
who
has
shown
that
birds
are
not
selecting
scale
tones
from
a
myriad
of
tonal
possibilities
,
but
are
filtering
out
and
reinforcing
the
available
set
of
overtones
from
the
fundamental
tones
of
their
vocal
cords
.
This
requires
``
far
less
musical
intelligence
and
deliberate
appropriation
''
,
and
in
this
regard
,
he
suggests
birdsong
has
something
in
common
with
Mongolian
throat-singing
and
jaw-harp
music
.
Sotorrio
also
claims
that
musicians
like
Rothernberg
are
deceived
by
``
a
peculiar
form
of
pareidolia
whereby
complex
tonal
information
is
reduced
to
human-scale
concepts
due
to
a
``
fixation
on
music
as
it
is
written
rather
than
