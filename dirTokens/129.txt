the

the

with

studies
over
recent
decades
have
looked
at
the
neural
mechanisms
underlying
birdsong

by
performing
lesions
to
relevant
brain
structures
involved
in
the
production
or
maintenance
of

by

another
recent
experimental
approach
was
recording
the
bird
song
and
then
playing
it
back
while
the
bird
is
singing
causing
perturbed
auditory
feedback
the
bird
hears
the
superposition
of
its
own
song
and
a

portion
of
a
previous

made

landmark
discovery
as
they
demonstrated
that
auditory

was
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
song
in
adult
birds
with

leonardo
konishi
designed
an
auditory

protocol
in
order
to
explore
the
role
of
auditory

in
adult
song
maintenance
further
to
investigate
how
adult
songs
deteriorate
after
extended
exposure
to
perturbed
auditory

and
to
examine
the
degree
to
which
adult
birds
could
recover
crystallized
song
over
time
after
being
removed
from
perturbed

exposure
this
study
offered
further
support
for
role
of
auditory

in
maintaining
adult
song
stability
and
demonstrated
how
adult

of
crystallized

is

a
model
in
which
lman

a
primary
role
in

as
it
detects
differences
between
the
song
produced
by
the
bird
and
its

song
template
and
then
sends
an
instructive
error
signal
to
structures
in

in
order
to
correct
or
modify
the
motor

in

prevented
any
further

in

there
are
two
competing

david
rothernberg
claims
that
birds
vocalize
traditional
scales
used
in
human
music
such
as
the
pentatonic
scale
and
diatonic
scale
providing
evidence
that
birdsong
not
only
sounds
like
music
but
is
music
in
the
human
sense
this
claim
has
been
refuted
by
sotorrio
who
has
shown
that
birds
are
not
selecting
scale
tones
from
a
myriad
of
tonal
possibilities
but
are
filtering
out
and
reinforcing
the
available
set
of
overtones
from
the
fundamental
tones
of
their
vocal
cords
this
requires
far
less
musical
intelligence
and
deliberate
appropriation
and
in
this
regard
he
suggests
birdsong
has
something
in
common
with
mongolian
and
music
sotorrio

that
musicians
like
rothernberg
are
deceived
by
a
peculiar
form

tonal
information
