history
edit
ancient
greeks
built
a
town
rhegion
at
the
site
of
reggio
a
strategic
site
beside
the
of
the
town
houses
two
bronze
statues
the
recovered
from
the
sea
at
riace
some
miles
to
the
the
third
century
bc
the
greeks
were
conquered
by
tribes
from
the
north
including
a
branch
of
the
samnites
called
the
bruttii
they
established
their
sovereignty
over
present
day
calabria
and
founded
new
cities
including
their
own
capital
consentia
now
known
as
cosenza
after
their
victory
in
the
bc
rome
occupied
calabria
and
it
remained
under
their
control
until
the
fifth
century
town
of
reggio
and
other
parts
of
the
province
as
well
as
messina
and
neighbouring
parts
of
sicily
were
devastated
by
the
messina
this
was
followed
by
a
series
of
tsunamis
that
wreaked
further
the
there
was
a
mass
migration
of
rural
people
from
reggio
calabria
and
other
provinces
in
southern
italy
to
the
cities
of
rome
milan
and
particularly
turin
in
the
north
they
were
driven
by
poverty
the
poor
soils
of
the
region
and
the
chronic
lack
of
employment
opportunities
to
move
to
places
with
more
thriving
and
southern
italy
suffered
from
urban
unrest
due
to
the
lack
of
employment
possibilities
and
poor
living
conditions
and
urban
protest
took
place
in
catanzaro
was
chosen
as
the
location
for
a
new
regional
government
catanzaro
and
reggio
calabria
were
among
the
poorest
cities
in
southern
italy
and
the
people
of
reggio
were
desperate
that
it
should
be
chosen
for
this
purpose
so
riots
broke
out
strikes
and
demonstrations
occurred
and
went
on
for
more
than
a
year
and
were
sometimes
put
down
brutally
by
the
police
the
railway
service
from
sicily
was
disrupted
the
airport
post
offices
and
tv
station
were
occupied
at
different
times
and
police
stations
were
assaulted
three
people
were
killed
more
than
two
hundred
wounded
and
over
four
hundred
were
charged
with
italian
government
responded
to
this
by
confirming
catanzaro
as
the
regional
capital
but
arranging
for
the
regional
assembly
to
be
held
at
reggio
a
new
port
and
were
announced
at
to
create
employment
in
the
area
but
before
the
steel
works
was
completed
the
price
of
steel
collapsed
and
the
steel
works
were
the
port
however
was
built
but
another
project
a
new
did
not
go
ahead
because
of
environmental
factors
the
port
has
since
become
a
busy
handling
more
than
three
million
each
year
and
new
roads
have
been
built
to
handle
the
resulting
increase
