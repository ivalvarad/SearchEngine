the
Greeks
were
conquered

tribes

,
including
a
branch
of
the
Samnites
called
the

They
established

the
1950s
there
was
a
mass
migration
of
rural
people
from
Reggio
Calabria
and
other
provinces
in
southern
Italy
to
the
cities
of
Rome
Milan
and
particularly
Turin
in
the
north
.
They
were
driven
by
poverty
,
the
poor
soils
of
the
region
and
the
chronic
lack
of

opportunities

1969
and
1973
,
southern
Italy
suffered
from
urban
unrest
due
to
the
lack
of
employment
possibilities
and
poor
living
conditions
,
and
urban
protest
took
place
.
In
1970
,
Catanzaro
was
chosen
as
the
location
for
a
new
regional
government
.
Catanzaro
and
Reggio
Calabria
were
among
the
poorest
cities
in
southern
Italy
and
the
people
of
Reggio
were
desperate
that
it
should
be
chosen
for
this
purpose
so
riots
broke
out
.
Strikes
and
demonstrations
occurred
and
went
on
for
more
than
a
year
,
and
were
sometimes
put
down
brutally
by
the
police
.
The
railway
service
from
Sicily
was
disrupted
,
the
airport
,
post
offices
and
TV
station
were
occupied
at
different
times
,
and
police
stations
were
assaulted
.
Three
people
were
killed
,
more
than
two
hundred
wounded
and
over
four
hundred
were
charged
with
public-order
-LSB-

-RSB-
Italian
government
responded
to
this
by
confirming
Catanzaro
as
the
regional
capital
but
arranging
for
the
regional
assembly
to
be
held
at
Reggio
.
A
new
port
and
were
announced
at
to
create
employment
in
the
area
,
but
before
the
steel
works
was
completed
,
the
price
of

collapsed

port
however
was
built

another

not
go

of
environmental
factors
.
The
port
has
since
become
a
busy
handling
more
than
three
million
each
year
,
and
new
roads

been
built
