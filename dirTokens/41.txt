RPG-7
Antitank
Grenade
Launcher
--
Capabilities
and
the
RPG-7
munition
has
two
sections
:
a
``
booster
''
section
and
a
``
warhead
and
sustainer
motor
''
section
.
These
must
be
assembled
into
the
ready-to-use
grenade
.
The
booster
consists
of
a
``
small
strip
powder
charge
''
that
serves
to
propel
the
grenade
out
of
the
launcher
;
the
sustainer
motor
then
ignites
and
propels
the
grenade
for
the
next
few
seconds
,
giving
it
a
top
speed
of
294meters
per
second
.
The
TRADOC
bulletin
provides
anecdotal
commentary
that
the
RPG-7
has
been
fired
from
within
buildings
,
which
agrees
with
the
two-stage
design
.
It
is
stated
that
only
a
2-meter
standoff
to
a
rear
obstruction
is
needed
for
use
inside
rooms
or
fortifications
.
The
fins
not
only
provide
drag
stabilization
,
but
are
designed
to
impart
a
slow
rotation
to
the
to
the
configuration
of
the
RPG-7
sustainer/warhead
section
,
it
responds
counter-intuitively
to
crosswinds
.
A
crosswind
will
tend
to
exert
pressure
on
the
stabilizing
fins
,
causing
the
projectile
to
turn
into
the
wind
.
While
the
rocket
motor
is
still
burning
,
this
will
cause
the
flight
path
to
curve
into
the
wind
.
The
TRADOC
bulletin
explains
aiming
difficulties
for
more
distant
moving
targets
in
crosswinds
at
some
length
.
Similar

a
the
RPG-7

no
noticeable
recoil

only
effect
during
firing
being
that
of
