-RSB-
that
the
CIA
organized
the
rescue
of
the
diplomats
who
were
hiding
in
the
Canadian
embassy
,
a
statement
which
echoes
what
former
US
President
said
about
the
operation
in
1986
,
however
Canada
's
historical
reticence
at
admitting
collaboration
with
US
foreign
intelligence
agencies
make
it
difficult
to
gauge
the
extent
of
Canadian
intelligence
involvement
and
whether
Taylor
acted
on
his
own
initiative
or
was
following
a
planned

by
a
CIA
agent
involved
in
the
incident
.
After
the
film
was
previewed
at
the
Toronto
International
Film
criticism
arose
that
the
film
unfairly
minimized
the
participation
of
the
Canadian
government
,
and
Taylor
,
in
the
extraction
operation
.
This
included
the
addition
to
the
film
of
several
fictional
events
for
dramatic
reasons
,
as
well
as
a
postscript
text
indicating
that
the
CIA
let
Taylor
take
the
credit
for
political
purposes
,
implying
that
he
did
not
deserve
the
accolades
he

noted
,
``

However
,
Affleck
did
respond
by
changing
the
postscript
text
to
read
,
``
