about

canada
historical
reticence
at
admitting
collaboration
with

foreign
intelligence
agencies
make
it
difficult
to
gauge
the
extent
of
canadian
intelligence
involvement
and
whether
taylor
acted
on

was
following

agent
involved
in
the
incident
after
the
film
was
previewed
at
the
toronto
international
film
criticism
arose
that
the
film
unfairly
minimized
the
participation
of
the
canadian
government
and
taylor
in
the
extraction
operation
this
included
the
addition
to
the
film
of
several
fictional
events
for
dramatic
reasons
as
well
as
a
postscript
text
indicating
that
the
cia
let
taylor
take
the
credit
for
political
purposes
implying
that
he
did
not
deserve
the
accolades
he
affleck
noted
because
we
say
it
based
on
a
true
story
rather
than
this
is
a
true
story
we
allowed
to
take
some
dramatic
license
there
a
spirit
of
however
affleck
did
respond
by
changing
the
postscript
text
to
read
the
involvement
of
the
cia
complemented
efforts
of
the
canadian
embassy
to
free
the
six

in
tehran

taylor
himself
said
that
the
film
was

it
thrilling
it
pertinent
it

noted
that
