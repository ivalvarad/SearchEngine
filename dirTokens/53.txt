The
High

is
the
court
of
final

with
the
ability
to
interpret
the
for
the
whole
of
Australia
,
not
just
the
state
or
territory
in
which
the
matter
arose
.
The
High
Court
's
broad
jurisdiction
is
similar
to
that
of
the
Court
of
and
unlike
the
Court
of
the
United
which
has
a
more
limited
jurisdiction
.
As
such
,
the
court
is
able
to
develop
the
common
law
consistently
across
all
the
states
and
territories
.
This
role
,
alongside
its
role
in
constitutional
interpretation
,
is
one
of
the

most
significant
.
As
Owen

of

is
divided
in
its
exercise
between

and

However
,
the
inclusion
of
constitutional
matters
in
section
76
,
rather
than
section
75
,
means
that
the
High
Court
's
original
jurisdiction
regarding
constitutional
matters
could
be
removed
.

-RRB-
are
broad
enough
that
many
constitutional
matters
would
still
be
within

.
The
original
constitutional
jurisdiction
of
the
High
Court
is
now
well
established
:
the
Law
Reform
has
described
the
inclusion
of
constitutional
matters
in
section
76
rather
than
section

as

The
Constitutional
recommended
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
the

being
removed
by
Parliament
.
Failure
to
proceed
on
this
issue
suggests
that
it
was
considered
highly
unlikely
that
Parliament
would
ever
take
this
requirement
of
``
a
matter
''
in
section
75
and
section
76
of
the

means
that
a

High
Court
's
appellate
jurisdiction
is
defined
under
Section
73
of
the
Constitution
.
The
High
Court
can
hear
appeals
from
the
Supreme
Courts
of
the
States
any
federal
court
or
court
exercising
federal
jurisdiction
-LRB-
such
as
the
Court
of
and
decisions
made
by
one
or
more
Justices
exercising
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
section
73
allows
the
appellate
jurisdiction
to
be
limited
``
with
such
exceptions
and
subject
to
such
regulations
as
the
Parliament
prescribes
''
.
Parliament
has
prescribed
a
large
limitation
in
section
35A
of
the
Act
This
requires
``
special
leave
''
to
appeal
.
Special
leave
is
granted
only
where
a
question
of
law
is
raised
that
is
of
public
importance
;
or
involves
a
conflict
between
courts
;
or
``
is
in
the
interests
of
the
administration
of
justice
''
.
Therefore
,
while
the
High
Court
is
the
final
court
of
appeal
,
it
can
not
be
considered
a
general
court
of
appeal
.
The
decision
as
to
whether
to
grant
special
leave
to
appeal
is
determined
by
one
or
more
Justices
of
the
High
Court

in
practice
,
a
panel
of
two
or
three
judges

issue
of
appeals
from
the
High
Court
to
the
United
Kingdom
's
Committee
of
the
Privy
was
a
significant
one
during
the
drafting
of
the
Constitution
and
it
continued
to
be
significant
in
the
years
after
the
court
's
final
wording
of
section
74
prohibited
appeals
on
constitutional
matters
involving
disputes
about
the
limits
of
Commonwealth
or
state
powers
,
except
where
the
High
Court
certified
the
appeal
.
It
did
so
only
once
:
in
the
case
of
Sugar
Refining
Co
v

-RSB-
After
that
case
,
in
which
the

refused
to
answer

constitutional
questions
put
to
it
,
the
High

never
certified

Indeed
,
in
the
case
of
v
Captain

,
the
court
said
that
it
would
never

of

general
matters
,
however
,
section
74
did
not
prevent
the
Privy
Council
from
granting
leave
to
appeal
against
the
High
Court
's
wishes
and
the
Council
did
so
often
.
In
some
cases
the
Council
acknowledged
that
the
Australian
common
law
had
developed
differently
from
English
law
and
thus
did
not
apply
its
own
principles

for
example
,
in
Consolidated
Press
Ltd
v

However
,
in
other
cases
,
the

by

.
In

,
Chief
Justice
Sir
Owen
Dixon
led
a
unanimous
judgment
that
rejected
a
precedent
of
the
of
in
v
saying
,
``
I
shall
not
depart
from
the
law
on
this
matter
as
we
have
long
since
laid
it
down
in

and
I
think
that

not
be
used

authority

the
following

the
Privy
Council
upheld
an
appeal
,
applying
the
House
of
Lords
-LSB-

-RSB-
74
did
provide
that
the
parliament
could
make
laws
to
prevent
appeals
to
the
council
and
it
did
so
,
beginning
in
1968
,
with
the
Council
-LRB-
Limitation
of
Appeals
-RRB-
Act
which
closed
off
all
appeals
to
the
Privy
Council
in
matters
involving
federal
legislation
.
In
1975
,
the
Council
-LRB-
Appeals
from
the
High
Court
-RRB-
Act
was
passed
,
which
had
the
effect
of
closing
all
routes
of
appeal
from
the
High
Court
.
Appeals
from
the
High
Court
to
the
Privy
Council
are
now
only
theoretically
possible
in
matters
if
the
High
Court
grants
a
certificate
of
appeal
under
section
74
of
the
Constitution
.
As
noted
above
,
the
High
Court
indicated
in
1985
it
would
not
grant
such
a
certificate
in
the
future
and
it
is
practically
certain
that
all
future
High
Courts
will
maintain
this
policy
.
In
1986
,
with
the
passing
of
the
by
both
the
and
the
Parliament
of
Australia
-LRB-
with
the
request
and
consent
of
the
Australian
States
-RRB-
,
appeals
to
the
Privy
Council
from
state
Supreme
Courts
were
closed
off
,
leaving
the
High
Court
as
the
only
avenue
of
jurisdiction
for

per
an
agreement
between
Nauru
and
Australia

,
in
application
of

the
of
the

for
the
sovereign
Republic
of

Thus
the
High
Court
may
hear
appeals
from
the

of
in
both
criminal
and
civil
cases
,
with
certain
exceptions
;

History

-RSB-
genesis
of
the
court
can
be
traced
back
to
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
.
Before
the
establishment
of
the
High
Court
,
appeals
from
the
state
Supreme
Courts
could
be
made
only
to
the
Judicial
Committee
of
the
Privy
Council
,
which
involved
the
great
expense
of
travelling
to
London
.
For
this
reason
some
politicians
in
the
colonies
wanted
a
new
court
that
could
travel
between
the
colonies
hearing
1846
proposal
for
federation
of
the
Australian
colonies
,
an
1849
report
from
the
Privy
Council
of
the
United
Kingdom
suggested
that
a
national
court
be
-LSB-

-RSB-
In
1856
,
the
then
of
South
Graves
suggested
to
the
of
South
that
they
and
the
other
colonies
should
consider
establishing
a
court
of
appeal
that
would
hear
appeals
from
the
Supreme
Courts
in
each
colony
,
and
in
1860
the
of
South
passed
legislation
encouraging
MacDonnell
to
put
forward
the
idea
to
his
colleagues
in
the
other
colonies
.
However
,
only
the
of
seriously
considered
this
-LSB-
17
-RSB-
an
inter-colonial
conference
in
1870
in
Melbourne
the
idea
of
an
inter-colonial
court
was
again
raised
and
subsequently
a
was
established
in
Victoria
to
investigate
options
for
establishing
a
court
of
appeal
and
for
unifying
extradition
laws
between
the
colonies
and
other
similar
matters
.
A
draft
bill
establishing
a
court
was
put
forward
by
the
Commission
,
but
it
completely
excluded
appeals
to
the
Privy
Council
,
which
reacted
critically
and
prevented
any
serious
attempts
to
implement
the
bill
in
London
-LRB-
before
federation
any
laws
affecting
all
the
colonies
would
have
to
be
passed
by
the

in

-RSB-
1880
another
inter-colonial
conference
was
convened
,
which
proposed
the
establishment
of
an
Australasian
Court
of
Appeal
.
This
conference
was
more
firmly
focussed
on
having
an
Australian
court
.
Another
draft
bill
was
produced
,
providing
that
judges
from
the
colonial
Supreme
Courts
would
serve
one-year
terms
on
the
new
court
,
with
one
judge
from
each
colony
at
a
given
time
.
New
Zealand
,
which
was
at
the
time
also
considering
joining
the
Australian
colonies
in
federation
,
was
also
to
be
a
participant
in
the
new
-LSB-

However
,
the
proposal
retained
appeals
from
colonial
Supreme
Courts
to
the
Privy
Council
,
which
some
of
the
colonies
disputed
,
and
the
bill
was
eventually
-LSB-

-RSB-
Samuel
first
Justice
of
of
the
1890s
,
which
met
to
draft
an
Australian
Constitution
,
also
raised
the
idea
of
a
federal
Supreme
Court
.
Initial
proposals
at
a
conference
in
Melbourne
in
February
1890
led
to
a
convention
in
Sydney
in
March
and
April
1891
,
which
produced
a
draft
constitution
.
The
draft
included
the
creation
of
a
Supreme
Court
of
Australia
,
which
would
not
only
interpret
the
Constitution
,
like
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
,
but
also
would
be
a
court
of
appeal
from
the
state
Supreme
Courts
.
The
draft
effectively
removed
appeals
to
the
Privy
Council
,
allowing
them
only
if
the
gave
leave
to
appeal
and
not
allowing
appeals
at
all
in
constitutional
draft
was
largely
the
work
of
Samuel
,

-RSB-
then
the
of
later
Chief
Justice
of
Queensland
and
the
first
Chief
Justice
of
Australia
.
Other
significant
contributors
to
the
judicial
clauses
in
the
draft
included
Attorney-General
of
Tasmania
Inglis
who
had
prepared
his
own
constitution
prior
to
the
convention
.
Inglis
Clark
's
most
significant
contribution
was
to
give
the
court
its
own
constitutional
authority
,
ensuring
the
of
the
original
formulation
from
Griffith
,
and
provided
only
that
the
parliament
could
establish

the
later
conventions
,
in
Adelaide
in
1897
,
in
Sydney
later
the
same
year
and
in
Melbourne
in
early
1898
,
there
were
changes
to
the
earlier
draft
.
In
Adelaide
,
the
name
of
the
court
was
changed
from
Supreme
Court
of
Australia
to
High
Court
of
Australia
.
Many
people
also
opposed
the
new
court
completely
replacing
the
Privy
Council
:
many
large
businesses
,
particularly
those
which
were
subsidiaries

-RSB-
which
involved
the
application
of

to

the

adopted
the
doctrine
of
implied
immunity
of
instrumentalities
which
had
been
established
in
the
United

case
of

doctrine
established
that
any
attempt
by

federal
government
to
interfere
with
the
legislative
or
executive
power
of
the
Australian
states
was
invalid
,
and
vice

Accompanying
that
doctrine
was
the
doctrine
of
State
which
was
based
on
the
principle
that
the
powers
of
the
Australian
parliament
should
be
interpreted
narrowly
,
to
avoid
intruding
on
areas
of
power
traditionally
exercise

1906
,
at
the
request
of
the
Justices
,
two
more
seats
were
added
to
the
bench
,
with
Isaacs
and
Higgins
the
appointees
.
After
O'Connor
's
death
in
1912
,
an
amendment
to
the
Act
expanded
the
bench
to
seven
.
For
most
of
1930
two
seats
were
left
vacant
due
to
monetary
constraints
placed
on
the
court
by
the
Depression
.
The
economic
downturn
had
also
led
to
a
reduction
in
litigation
and
consequently
less
work
for
the
court
.
After
Sir
Isaac
Isaacs
retired
in
1931
,
his
seat
was
left
empty
,
and
in
1933
an
amendment
to
the
officially
reduced
the
number
of
seats
to
six
.
However
,
this
led
to
some
decisions
being
split
three-all
.
With
the
appointment
of
in
1946
,
the
number
of
seats
returned
to
seven
,
and
since
then
the
court
has
had
a
full
complement
of
seven
