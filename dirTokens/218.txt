into

in

at

shaper
ended
up
going
after
portal
instead
when
portal
began
using
chris
powell
amulet
to
become
the
darkhawk
in
chris
place
meanwhile
members
of
the
mahari
race
another
alien
species
from
the
same
home
world
as
kistur
took
control
of
the
darkhawk
ship
in
a

they
reanimated

overhawk
and
went
after

family
in
the
end
portal
and
darkhawk
managed
to
prevent
them
from
destroying
the
volumeissueneeded
is
not
a
criminal
and
can
not
truly
be
called
a
villain
he
is
not
so
much
evil
as
amoral
mistrustful
of
others
because
of
his
being
harassed
by
those
who
would
exploit
his
mutant
abilities
while
he
may
return
a
favor
to
those
who
have
helped
him
as
he
did
by
retrieving
when
sleepwalker
had
him
freed
from
sauron
mind
volumeissueneeded
and
filling
in
for
darkhawk
because
of
their
past
volumeissueneeded
he
is
otherwise
a
loner
who
is
not
generally
inclined
to
heroism
he
will
do
whatever
he
feels
he
must
to
survive
although
never
more
than
necessary
such
as
when
he
used
to
subdue
the
technicians
studying
his
darkhawk
armor
not
needing
to
kill
is
one
of
the
few
mutants
that
retained
their
superhuman
powers
after
the
volumeissueneeded
he
is
shown
as
the
director
of
and
he
used
his
powers
to
transport
and
jocasta
to
the
he
collects
jocasta
after
machine
man
retrieves
a
sample
of
the
tissues
but
is
forced
to
leave
a
badly
damaged
machine
man
after
fending
off
with
the
help
of
jocasta
machine
man
and
the
morbius
the
zombies
that
invaded
portal
discovered
that
some
of
them
managed
to
escape

to
destroy
the

and
edit
is
a
mutant
capable
of
opening
rifts
in
space
passing
through
warps
to
transport
himself
and
others
his
portals
allow
instantaneous
travel
between
different
planes
of
reality
or
dimensions
opening
a
portal
without
preparation
will
give
him
access
to
another
dimension
completely
at
seems
to
possess
some
talent
for
finding
dimensions
he
has
been
to
before
yet
he
could
not
immediately
find
earth
again
once
he
first
got
lost
in
the
dimensional
planes
presumably
then
portal
has
a
kind
of
extrasensory
marking
ability
allowing
him
to
record
the
coordinates
of
a
dimension
while
he
is
present
in
it
so
that
he
could
return
to
it
again
in
the
future
if
he
chooses
he
could
not
automatically
return
to
earth
because
he
had
not
consciously
marked
it
before
leaving
portal
is
capable
of
using
his
powers
for
teleportation
traveling
instantly
across
about
a
few
miles
within
a
single
dimension
trying
to
transport
himself
more
than
a
few
miles
in
one
jump
however
will
destabilize
the
portal
and
send
him
off
into
another
dimension
even
if
he
is
trying
to
stay
anchored
in
one
dimensional
warps
created
by

also
been
shown
to
be
able
to
home
in
on
other
people
who
have
gone
through
one
of
his
portals
opening
a
new
gateway
to
retrieve
or
follow
them
if
necessary
he
used
this
ability
to
rescue
from
the
