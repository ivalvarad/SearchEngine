on

and

some

themselves

those

gradually
by

molts
an
insect
molts
when
it
outgrows
its
exoskeleton
which
does
not
stretch
and
would
otherwise
restrict
the
insect
growth
the
molting
process
begins
as
the
insect
epidermis
secretes
a
new
epicuticle
inside
the
old
one
after
this
new
epicuticle
is
secreted
the
epidermis
releases
a
mixture
of
enzymes
that
digests
the
endocuticle
and
thus
detaches
the
old
cuticle
when
this
stage
is
complete
the
insect
makes
its
body
swell
by
taking
in
a
large
quantity
of
water
or
air
which
makes
the
old
cuticle
split
along
predefined
weaknesses

holometabolism

changes
in
four
stages
an
egg

a
larva
a
pupa

the
adult

imago

an
egg
hatches
to
produce
a
larva

this
form

be
one
of
several
varieties
eruciform
scarabaeiform
campodeiform
elongated
flattened

the

active

is
an
important
defense
strategy

this

among

the

is
most
commonly
known
by

later
research
has
discovered
that
the

this

a
