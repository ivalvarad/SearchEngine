Locomotion
As
it
allows
for
rapid
yet
stable
movement
,
many
insects
adopt
a
tripedal
gait
in
which
they
walk
with
their
legs
touching
the
ground
in
alternating
triangles
.
Insects
are
the
only
invertebrates
to
have
evolved
flight

Many
insects
spend
at
least
part
of
their
lives
under
water
,
with
larval
adaptations
that
include
gills
and
some
adult
insects
are
aquatic
and
have
adaptations
for
swimming

Some

Insects
are
mostly
solitary
,
but
some

such
as
certain
bees
ants
and
termites
are
social
and
live
in
large
,
well-organized
colonies
.
Some
insects

such
as
earwigs

maternal
care
,

their
eggs
and
young

Insects
can
communicate
with
each
other
in
a
variety
of
ways
.
Male
moths
can
sense
the
pheromones
of
female
moths
over
great
distances
.
Other
species
communicate
with
sounds
:
crickets
stridulate
or
rub
their
wings
together
,
to
attract
a
mate
and
repel
other
males
.
Lampyridae

the

with
regard
certain
insects
as
pests
and
attempt
to
control
them
using
insecticides
and
a
host
of
other
techniques

Some
insects
damage
crops
by
feeding
on
sap
,
leaves
or
fruits
A
few
parasitic
species
are

insects
perform
complex
ecological
roles

rather
than

it

proved
better
to
use
monophyletic
groupings
-LRB-
in
which
the

The

two
groups
historically
treated
as
subclasses
:
wingless
insects
,
known
as
Apterygota
,
and
winged
insects
,
known
as
Pterygota
.
The
Apterygota
consist
of
the
primitively
wingless
order
of
the
silverfish

Thysanura

Archaeognatha

up
the
Monocondylia
based
on
the
shape
of
their
mandibles
while
Thysanura
and
Pterygota
are
grouped

that

themselves

not

in

Neoptera
can
further
be
divided
into
incomplete

Polyneoptera
and
Paraneoptera
and
complete
metamorphosis-based
groups
.
It
has
proved
difficult
to
clarify
the
relationships
between
the
orders
in
Polyneoptera
because
of
constant
new
findings
calling
for
revision
of
the

.
For
example

Paraneoptera

turned
out
to
be
more
closely
related
to
Endopterygota
than
to
the
rest
of
the

The
recent
molecular
finding
that
the
traditional
