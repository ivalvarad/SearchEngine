to
have
incorporated

included

arrangement
of
banksia
was
placed
between
now
subsp
compar
and
scarlet
banksia
in
no
infrageneric
arrangement
was
provided
other
than
the
removal
of
one
distinctive
species
into
a
subgenus
of
its
own
because
of
its
unusual
domed
flower
head
as
flowers
occur
in
characteristic
flower
spikes
it
was
retained
in
the
true
was
renamed
eubanksia
by
austrian
botanist
in
with
remaining
between
the
same
two
species
as
in
brown
more
detailed
was
published
by
in
eubanksia
was
demoted
to
sectional
rank
and
divided
it
into
four
series
was
placed
in
series
salicinae
because
its
leaves
are
more
or
less
linear
and
have
white
based
as
they
were
on
leaf
characters
meissner
series
were
highly
and
discarded
them
all
in
revision
of
banksia
was
instead
placed
in
a
new
section
oncostylis
because
of
its
hooked
this
arrangement
would
stand
for
over
a
many
years
there
was
confusion
between
and
swamp
banksia
until
the
latter
was
circumscribed
as
encompassing
what
is
now
river
banksia
which
has
whorled
leaves
like
thus
it
was
easy
to
perceive
as
falling
within
the
range
of
variation
of
this
broadly
defined
species
the
confusion
was
largely
cleared
up
once
was
recognised
as
a
distinct
taxon
published
a
new
taxonomic
arrangement
of
banksia
in
his
landmark
monograph
genus
banksia
endlicher
eubanksia
became
banksia
and
was
divided
into
three
sections
one
of
which
was
oncostylis
oncostylis
was
further
divided
into
four
series
with
placed
in
series
spicigerae
because
its
inflorescences
are
and
pauline
ladiges
published
a
new
arrangement
for
the
genus
after
cladistic
analyses
yielded
a
cladogram
significantly
different
to
george
arrangement
with
respect
to
their
findings
largely
accorded
with
george
arrangement
section
oncostylis
was
discarded
as
polyphyletic
but
series
spicigerae
was
inferred
to
be
monophyletic
and
appeared
in
a
succession
of
clades
with
the
species
previously
identified
as
its
closest
relatives
first
then
then
and
finally
red
swamp
clade
became
the
basis
of
thiele
and
ladiges
occidentales
which
was
defined
as
characterised
by
seedling
leaves
and
adult
leaves
in
true
this
arrangement
stood
until
when
george
largely
reverted
to
his
arrangement
in
his
monograph
for
the
of
series
under
taxonomic
arrangement
of

these

not
