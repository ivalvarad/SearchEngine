is
a
that
specifies
the
north-south
position
of
a
point
on

's
surface
.
Latitude
is
an
angle

from

Lines
of

,
or

run
east-west
as
circles

.
Latitude
is
used
together
with
longitude
to
specify
the
precise
location
of
features
on
the
surface
of
the
Earth
.
Two
levels
of
abstraction
are
employed
in
the
definition
of
these
coordinates
.
In
the
first
step
the
physical
surface
is
modelled
by
the
geoid
a
surface
which
approximates
the
sea
over
the
oceans
and
its
continuation
under
the
land
masses
.
The
second
step
is
to
approximate
the
geoid
by
a
mathematically
simpler
reference
surface
.
The
simplest
choice
for
the
reference
surface
is
a
sphere
but
the
geoid
is
more
accurately
modelled
by
an
ellipsoid
The
definitions
of
latitude
and
longitude
on
such
reference
surfaces
are
detailed
in
the
following
sections
.
Lines
of
constant
latitude
and
longitude
together
constitute
a
graticule
on
the
reference
surface
.
The
latitude
of
a
point
on
the
actual
surface
is
that
of
the
corresponding
point
on
the
reference
surface
,
the
correspondence
being
along
the
normal
to
the
reference
surface
which
passes
through
the
point
on
the
physical
surface
.
Latitude
and
longitude
together
with
some
specification
of
height
constitute
a
coordinate
as
defined
in
the
specification
of
the
ISO
19111

there
are

the
latitude
of
a
feature
on
the
surface

not
unique
:
this
is
stressed
in
the
ISO
standard
which
states
that
``
without

specification
of

,
coordinates
-LRB-

and

-RRB-

ambiguous

and

''
.
This

equal

The

this
is
impossible
in
the
four
remaining
cases
:

for

The
methods
available
are

.
The
other
,
more
useful
,
approach
is
to
express
the
auxiliary
latitude
as
a
series
in
terms
of
the
geodetic
latitude
and
then
invert
the
series
by
the
method
