latitude
is
a
that
specifies
the
position
of
a
point
on
the
earth
surface
latitude
is
an
angle
defined
below

ranges
from
at

equator
to

or
south
at
the
poles
lines
of
constant
latitude
or

run
as
circles
parallel

latitude
is
used
together
with
longitude
to
specify
the
precise
location
of
features
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
two
levels
of
abstraction
are
employed
in
the
definition
of
these
coordinates
in
the
first
step
the
physical
surface
is
modelled
by
the
geoid
a
surface
which
approximates
the
sea
over
the
oceans
and
its
continuation
under
the
land
masses
the
second
step
is
to
approximate
the
geoid
by
a
mathematically
simpler
reference
surface
the
simplest
choice
for
the
reference
surface
is
a
sphere
but
the
geoid
is
more
accurately
modelled
by
an
ellipsoid
the
definitions
of
latitude
and
longitude
on
such
reference
surfaces
are
detailed
in
the
following
sections
lines
of
constant
latitude
and
longitude
together
constitute
a
graticule
on
the
reference
surface
the
latitude
of
a
point
on
the
actual
surface
is
that
of
the
corresponding
point
on
the
reference
surface
the
correspondence
being
along
the
normal
to
the
reference
surface
which
passes
through
the
point
on
the
physical
surface
latitude
and
longitude
together
with
some
specification
of
height
constitute
a
coordinate
as
defined
in
the
specification
of
the
iso
there
are
many
different
the
latitude
of
a
feature
on
the
surface
is
not
unique
this
is
stressed
in
the
iso
standard
which
states
that
without
the
full
specification
of
the
coordinate
reference
system
coordinates
that
is
latitude
and
longitude
are
ambiguous
at
best
and
meaningless
at
worst
this
is
of
great
importance
in
accurate
applications
such
as
gps
but
in
common
usage
where
high
accuracy
is
not
required
the
reference
ellipsoid
is
not
usually

the
latitude
angle
defined

usually
denoted

the
greek
letter
phi
or
it
is
measured
in

decimal
degrees
north

an
understanding

an
example
of
the
use
of
the
rectifying

is
the
conic
snyder
section
the
rectifying
latitude
is
also
of
great
importance
in

construction
of

also
authalic

for

gives

transformation

example
of
the
use
of
the
authalic
latitude
is
the
conic
edit
gives
an
conformal
transformation
to
the
x
is
the
see
also
the
conformal
latitude
defines
a
transformation
from
the
ellipsoid
to
a
sphere
of
arbitrary
radius
such
that
the
angle
of
intersection
between
any
two
lines
on
the
ellipsoid
is
the
same
as
the
corresponding
angle
on
the
sphere
so
that
the
shape
of
small
elements
is
well
preserved
a
further
conformal
transformation
from
the
sphere
to
the
plane
gives
a
conformal
double
projection
from
the
ellipsoid
to
the
plane
this
is
not
the
only
way
of
generating
such
a
conformal
projection
for
example
the
exact
version
of
the
mercator
on
the
ellipsoid
is
not
a
double
projection
it
does
however
involve
a
generalisation
of
the
conformal
latitude
to
the
complex
edit
is
conventionally
denoted
by
not
to
be
confused
with
the
geocentric
latitude
it
is
used
in
the
development
of
the
ellipsoidal
versions
of
the
normal
and
the
mercator
the
name
isometric
arises
from
the
fact
that
at
any
point
on
the
ellipsoid
equal
increments
of
and
longitude
give
rise
to
equal
distance
displacements
along
the
meridians
and
parallels
respectively
the
graticule
defined
by
the
lines
of
constant
and
constant
divides
the
surface
of
the
ellipsoid
into
a
mesh
of
squares
of
varying
size
the
isometric
latitude
is
zero
at
the
equator
but
rapidly
diverges
from
the
geodetic
latitude
tending
to
infinity
at
the
poles
the
conventional
notation
is
given
in
snyder
page
the
normal
mercator
projection
on
the
ellipsoid
this
function
defines
the
spacing
of
the
parallels
if
the
length
of
the
equator
on
the
projection
is
e
units
of
length
or
pixels
then
the
distance
y
of
a
parallel
of
latitude
from
the
equator
isometric
latitude
is
closely
related
to
the
conformal
formulae
and
edit
formulae
in
the
previous
sections
give
the
auxiliary
latitude
in
terms
of
the
geodetic
latitude
the
expressions
for
the
geocentric
and
reduced
latitudes
may
be
inverted
directly
but
this
is
impossible
in
the
four
remaining
cases
the
rectifying
authalic
conformal
and
isometric
latitudes
there
are
two
methods
of
proceeding
the
first
is
a
numerical
inversion
of
the
defining
equation
for
each
and
every
particular
value
of
the
auxiliary
latitude
the
methods
available
are
and
root
finding
the
other
more
useful
approach
is
to
express
the
auxiliary
latitude
as
a
series
in
terms
of
the
geodetic
latitude
and
then
invert
the
series
by
the
method
of
such
series
are
presented
by
adams
who
uses
taylor
series
expansions
and
gives
coefficients
in
terms
of
the
derives
series
to
arbitrary
order
by
using
the
computer
algebra
package
and
expresses
the
coefficients
in
terms
of
both
eccentricity
and
flattening
the
series
method
is
not
applicable
to
the
isometric
latitude
and
one
must
use
the
conformal
latitude
in
an
intermediate
comparison

the

and
the

than
the

diverges

case
the
