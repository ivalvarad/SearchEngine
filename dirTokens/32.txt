explain
a
bit
more
in

the
point
is
that
a
successful

article
is
based
almost
on
what
people
unconnected
with
the

have
published
about
them
wikipedia
has
hardly
any
interest
in
what
somebody
says
about
themselves
or
what
their
friends

or

say
about
them
or
even
in
what

done
unless
and
until
somebody
unconnected

looking
up

i
had
a

i
had
a

how
to

i
could
not
find
out
how
or
where
nightlink
is

time
when
people
can
become
vulnerable

so
they
have
a

they
can
call

be
able
to
speak
to
someone
at
any
time
of
the
night
it
is
similar
to
all
the
other
organisations
but
from
there
website
it
is
mainly
in
cornwall
there
is
probably
more
information
but
i
have
not

any
at

do
agree
with
the
hovercard

oxygen
as
shown

electrolysis

hovercard

textual

the

and
not
of

in
its
natural
form
as
the
infocard
presents
or
of
the

itself
i
believe
either
of
these
would
be
more
than
a
diagram
of
a
chemistry
concept
and
was
wondering
how

can
use

my
advice
to
a
new
user
wanting
to
create
a
new

is
that
it
is
difficult
to
write
an
article
which
gets
accepted
and
i
would
always
advise
anybody
to
spend
a
few
weeks
improving
existing

first
to
get
the
hang
of
how
wikipedia
works
otherwise
they
are
going
to
have
a
frustrating
time
i
also
note
that
when
somebody
comes
new
to
wikipedia
with
the
intention
of
creating
a
new
article
they
are
often
here
to
promote
some
subject
and
usually

section

up

odd
confusing
that
i
never
seen
before
so
i
not
sure
how
to
fix
all
the
reference
instead
of
full
inline
citations
being
attached
to
content
in
the
body
the
full
cites
except
and
were
added
directly
to
the

section
with
only
nicknames
in
the
body
can
someone
fix
all
of
this
czoal
talk
october
references
are
all
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
just
the
ref
names
are
used
in
the
body
of
the
text
it
makes
it
so
when
you
edit
the
text
you
do
have
to
wade
through
reference
information
the
errors
are
because
a
reference
was
defined
but
was
never
actually
used
in
the
prose
just
delete
the
named
references
that
are
not
used
to
fix
the
errors
see
for
more
information
talk
october
but
it
just
seems
really
odd
doing
it
this
way
instead
of
the
traditional
way
and
i
not
sure
if
you
saw
but
the
hidden
instructions
in
the
refs
section
says
citation
templates
are
not
forbidden
czoal
talk
october
utc
i
saw
it
the
full
comment
is
while
other
citation
templates
are
not
forbidden
this
basic
template
can
be
used
and
it
is
placed
here
for
convenience
it
was
probably
left
by
the
original
author
as
a
helpful
note
personally
i
prefer
the
references
method
since
as
i
mentioned
above
it
makes
editing
the
text
much
easier
especially
on
articles
with
a
large
amount
of
references
also
you
should
change
the
style
that
is
used
on
articles
there
is
no
traditional
style
the
first
person
that
adds
a
reference
gets
to
pick
what
style
they
use
and
per
wp
citevar
it
should
be
changed
talk
october
utc
something
new
every
day
i
just
do
like
it
because
filling
in
a
template
is
much
easier
plus
there
no
inconvenience
of
having
to
put
sources
in
alphabetical
order
thanks
for
the
info
though

the
way

you
