a

more
in

Lux44-musicpages
the
point
is
that
a
successful
Wikipedia
article
is
based
almost
100
%
on
what
people
unconnected
with
the
subject
have
published
about
them
.
Wikipedia
has
hardly
any
interest
in
what
somebody
says
about
themselves
,
or
what
their
friends
,
relatives
,
or
associates
say
about
them
;
or
even
in
what
they
have
done
,
unless
and
until
somebody
unconnected
with
them
writes
about
it
.
Does
that
make
things
clearer
?

was
looking
up
Nightlink
on
your
Website
,
and
I
had
a
Nightlink
to
add
to
your
page
,
I
had
a
look
at
how
to
add
the
new
Information
,
but
I
could
not
find
out
how
or
where
.
Nightlink
is
a
Volunteer
Service
at
Night
time
when
people
can
become
vulnerable
and
scared
or
disorientated
,
so
they
have
a
number
they
can
call
and
be
able
to
speak
to
someone
at
any
time
of
the
night
.
It
is
similar
to
all
the
other
organisations
,
but
from
there
website
,
it
is
mainly
in
Cornwall
.
There
is
probably
more
information
but
I
have
not
found
any
at
the
moment
,
but
I
thought
you
may
like
to
add
this
small
addition
to
your
page
if
you
think
it
worthy
of
a
space
.
Thank
you

However

this

a

there

I

place
,
as
the

contains
no

,
but
anonymous
users
can
use
the
for
my
advice
to
a
new
user
wanting
to
create
a
new
article
is
that
it
is
DIFFICULT
to
write
an
article
which
gets
accepted
,
and
I
would
always
advise
anybody
to
spend
a
few
weeks
improving
existing
articles
first
,
to
get
the
hang
of
how
Wikipedia
works
,
otherwise
they
are
going
to
have
a
frustrating
time
.
I
also
note
that
when
somebody
comes
new
to
Wikipedia
with
the
intention
of
creating
a
new
article
,
they
are
often
here
to
promote
some
subject
,
and
usually
are
not
aware
that
promotion
of
any
kind
is
forbidden
on
Wikipedia
,
and
that
an
article
should
be
based
nearly
100
%
on
what
people
unconnected
with
the
subject
have
published
about
it
,
and
hardly
at
all
on
what
the
subject
,
their
friends
,
relative
,
employees
,
publishers
,
agents
or
associates
want
to
say
about
them
.

I

I
am
the

The

an

A
constant

it
was
published
in

When

in

I
tried

add
the

all
at

just
the
ref
names

It
makes
it
so
when
you
edit
the
text
you
do
n't
have
to
wade
through
reference
information
.
The
errors
are
because
a
reference
was
defined

was
never

used

Just
delete

I
saw
it
.
The
full
comment
is
:
While
other
citation
templates
are
not
forbidden
,
this
basic
template
can
be
used
,
and
it
is
placed
here
for
convenience
:
.
It
was
probably
left
by
the
original
author
as
a
helpful
note
.
Personally
,
I
prefer
the
list-defined
references
method
since
,
as
I
mentioned
above
,
it
makes
editing
the
text
much
easier
.
Especially
on
articles
with
a
large
amount
of
references
.
Also
,
you
should
n't
change
the
style
that
is
used
on
articles
.
There
is
no
``
traditional
''
style
.
The
first
person
that
adds
a
reference
gets
to
pick
what
style
they
use
and
per
WP
:
CITEVAR
it
should
n't
be
changed
.

I
just
do
n't
like
it
because
filling

a

is
much
easier

Plus
,
there
's
no
inconvenience

Thanks
