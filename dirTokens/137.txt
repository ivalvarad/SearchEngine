omnivore

is
an
animal
whose
species
normally
derives
its
energy
and
nutrients
from
a
diet
consisting
of
a
variety
of
food
sources
that
may
include
plants
animals
algae
fungi
and
bacteria
term

omnes
omnia
meaning
all
or
everything
and
vorare
meaning
to
are
often
opportunistic
that
lack
carnivore
or
herbivore
specializations

acquiring
or
processing

etymology
edit
word
omnivore
is
a
term
of
convenience
and
its
significance
varies
according
to
the
context
of
the
type
and
degree
of
omnivore
is
derived
from
the
latin
omnis
all
and
vora
from
vorare
to
eat
or
devour
traditionally
the
definition
for
omnivory
relies
on
a
species
including
both
animal
and
vegetable
tissue
in
the
the
taxonomic
utility
of
this
definition
is
limited
since
the
diet
behavior
and
phylogeny
of
one
omnivorous
species
might
be
very
different
from
that
of
another
for
instance
an
omnivorous
pig
digging
for
roots
and
scavenging
for
fruit
and
carrion
is
taxonomically
and
ecologically
quite
distinct
from
an
omnivorous
chameleon
that
eats
leaves
and
insects
the
term
omnivory
is
also
not
comprehensive
because
it
does
not
deal
with
mineral
foods
such
as
for
edit
carnivora
is
a
taxon
for
species
classification
no
such
equivalent
exists
for
omnivores
as
omnivores
are
widespread
across
multiple
taxonomic
clades
the
carnivora
order
does
not
include
all
carnivorous
species
and
not
all
species
within
the
carnivora
taxon
are
the
eating
of
flesh
is
phylogenetically
species
are
difficult
to
classify
as
either
omnivores
herbivores
or
carnivores
because
few
animals
are
strictly
limited
to
just
one
type
of
tissue
in
the
even
the
cat
and
usually
regarded
as
obligate
carnivores
eat
a
little
vegetable
matter
for
instance
when
they
eat
the
guts
of
prey
although
this
does
not
prove
that
they
derive
nutrition
from
it
only
certain
species
like
parasitoidal
insects
and
insects
that
are
specialist
can
be
easily
classified
based
on
their
nutrient
another
problem
with
classifying
species
as
omnivore
herbivore
or
carnivore
concerns
changes
in
eating
habits
through
an
animal
life
cycle
certain
species
such
as
some
grazing
waterfowls
like
geese
are
known
to
eat
mainly
animal
tissue
at
one
stage
of
their
lives
and
plant
matter
at
the
same
is
true
for
many
insects
such
as
beetles
in
the
family
which
begin
by
eating
animal
tissue
as
larvae
but
change
to
plant
matter
after
they
mature
likewise
many
mosquito
species
begin
with
plants
or
assorted
detritus
as
they
mature
however
the
males
continue
to
eat
plant
matter
and
nectar
but
the
females
such
as
those
of
anopheles
aedes
and
culex
in
addition
to
nectar
also
eat
blood
in
order
to
reproduce
edit
general
edit
cases
exist
of
carnivores
eating
plant
matter
and
herbivores
eating
meat
the
classification
omnivore
refers
to
the
adaptations
and
main
food
source
of
the
species
in
general
so
these
exceptions
do
not
make
either
individual
animals
or
the
species
as
a
whole
omnivorous
for
the
concept
of
omnivore
to
be
regarded
as
a
some
clear
set
of
measurable
and
relevant
criteria
would
need
to
be
considered
to
differentiate
between
an
omnivore
and
other
categories
faunivore
folivore
and
scavenger
some
researchers
argue
that
evolution
of
any
species
from
herbivory
to
carnivory
or
carnivory
to
herbivory
would
be
rare
except
via
an
intermediate
stage
of
edit
mammals
are
omnivorous
in
the
wild
such
as
species
of
pigs
badgers
bears
coatis
hedgehogs
opossums
skunks
sloths
squirrels
raccoons
chipmunks
mice
and
rats
hominidae
including
humans
and
chimpanzees
are
most
bear
species
are
bear
species
are
but
individual
diets
can
range
from
almost
exclusively
herbivorous
to
almost
exclusively
carnivorous
depending
on
what
food
sources
are
available
locally
and
seasonally
are
classified
as
carnivores
both
taxonomically
they
are
in
the
order
carnivora
and
behaviorally
they
subsist
on
a
largely
carnivorous
diet
depending
on
the
species
of
bear
there
is
generally
a
preference
for
one
class
of
food
as
plants
and
animals
are
digested
differently
wolf
subspecies
including
wolves
dogs
dingoes
and
coyotes
have
a
general
preference
and
are
evolutionarily
geared
towards
meat
but
also
will
voluntarily
eat
plant
material
like
fruits
vegetables
and
grasses
and
can
live
on
such
also
the
is
a
canid
whose
diet
is
naturally
plant
most
mammals
may
display
omnivorous
behavior
patterns
depending
on
conditions
of
supply
culture
season
and
so
on
they
will
generally
prefer
a
particular
class
of
food
to
which
their
digestive
processes
are
adapted
like
most
arboreal
species
most
squirrels
are
primarily
granivores
subsisting
on
nuts
and
but
like
virtually
all
mammals
squirrels
avidly
consume
some
animal
food
when
it
becomes
available
for
example
the
american
gray
has
been
introduced
by
humans
to
parts
of
britain
continental
europe
and
south
africa
where
it
flourishes
its
effect
on
populations
of
nesting
birds
is
often
serious
largely
because
of
consumption
of
eggs
and
edit
birds
are
omnivorous
with
diets
varying
from
berries
and
nectar
to
insects
worms
fish
and
small
rodents
examples
include
cassowaries
chickens
crows
and
related
corvids
keas
rallidae
and
rheas
in
addition
some
lizards
turtles
fish
such
as
piranhas
and
catfish
and
invertebrates
are
also
often
mainly
herbivorous
creatures
will
eagerly
eat
small
quantities
of
animal
food
when
it
becomes
available
although
this
is
trivial
most
of
the
time
omnivorous
or
herbivorous
birds
such
as
sparrows
often
will
feed
their
chicks
insects
while
food
is
most
needed
for
on
close
inspection
it
appears
that
birds
such
as
sunbirds
rely
on
the
ants
and
other
insects
that
they
find
in
flowers
not
for
a
richer
supply
of
protein
but
for
essential
nutrients
such
as
cyanocobalamin
that
are
absent
from
nectar
similarly
monkeys
of
many
species
eat
maggoty
fruit
sometimes
in
clear
preference
to
sound
when
to
refer
to
such
animals
as
omnivorous
or
otherwise
is
a
question
of
context
and
emphasis
rather
than
