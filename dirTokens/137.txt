word
``
omnivore

its

varies
according

Omnivore

and
vora
from

to

Traditionally
the
definition
for
omnivory
relies
on
a
species
``
including
both
animal
and
vegetable
tissue
in
the
-LSB-
3
-RSB-
The
taxonomic
utility
of
this
definition
is
limited
,
since
the
diet
,
behavior
,
and
phylogeny
of
one
omnivorous
species
might
be
very
different
from
that
of
another
:
for
instance
,
an
omnivorous
pig
digging
for
roots
and
scavenging
for
fruit
and
carrion
is
taxonomically
and
ecologically
quite
distinct
from
an
omnivorous
chameleon
that
eats
leaves
and
insects
.
The
term
``
omnivory
''
is
also
not
comprehensive
because
it
does
not
deal
with
mineral
foods
such

Carnivora
is
a
taxon
for
species
classification
,
no
such
equivalent
exists
for
omnivores

as
omnivores
are
widespread
across
multiple
taxonomic
clades
The
Carnivora
order
does
not
include

species
are
difficult
to
classify
as
either

Even
the

usually
regarded
as

eat

little

for
instance
when
they
eat
the
guts
of
prey
,
although
this
does
not
prove
that
they
derive
nutrition
from
it
.
Only
certain
species
like
parasitoidal
insects
and
insects
that
are
specialist
sap-suckers
can
be
easily
classified
based
on
their

-LSB-

Another
problem
with
classifying
species
as
omnivore
,
herbivore
,
or
carnivore
concerns
changes
in
eating
habits
through
an
animal
's
life
cycle
.
Certain
species
,
such
as
some
grazing
waterfowls
like
geese
,
are
known
to
eat
mainly
animal
tissue
at
one
stage
of
their
lives
,
and
plant
matter
at

-RSB-
The
same
is
true
for
many
insects
,
such
as
beetles
in
the
family
-LSB-
7
-RSB-
which
begin
by
eating
animal
tissue
as
larvae
but
change
to
plant
matter
after
they
mature
.
Likewise
,
many
mosquito
species
begin
with
plants
or
assorted
detritus
.
As
they
mature
,
however
,
the
males
continue
to
eat
plant
matter
and
nectar
,
but
the
females
-LRB-
such
as
those
of
Anopheles
Aedes
and
Culex
in
addition
to
nectar
,
also
eat
blood
in
order
to
reproduce

General

-RSB-
cases
exist
of
carnivores
eating
plant
matter
and
herbivores
eating
meat
,
the
classification
``
omnivore
''
refers
to
the
adaptations
and
main
food
source
of
the
species
in
general
,
so
these
exceptions
do
not
make
either
individual
animals
or
the
species
as
a
whole
omnivorous
.
For
the
concept
of
``
omnivore
''
to
be
regarded
as
a
some
clear
set
of
measurable
and
relevant
criteria
would
need
to
be
considered
to
differentiate
between
an
``
omnivore
''
and
other
categories
,
e.g.
faunivore
folivore
and
scavenger
.

Depending

there
is
generally
a
preference
for
one

Wolf

Like

most

-LSB-

-RSB-
But
like
virtually
all
mammals
,
squirrels
avidly
consume
some
animal
food
when
it
becomes
available
.
For
example
,
the
American
gray
has
been
introduced
by
humans
to
parts
of
Britain
,
continental
Europe
and
South
Africa
.
Where
it
flourishes
,
its
effect
on
populations
of
nesting
birds
is
often
serious
,
largely
because
of
consumption
of
eggs
and

birds
are
omnivorous
,
with
diets
varying
from
berries
and
nectar
to
insects
worms
fish
and
small
rodents
Examples
include
cassowaries
chickens
crows
-LSB-
22
-RSB-
and
related
corvids
keas
rallidae
and
rheas
In
addition
,
some
lizards
turtles
fish
-LRB-
such
as
piranhas
and
catfish
and
invertebrates
are
also
often
,
mainly
herbivorous
creatures
will
eagerly
eat
small
quantities
of
animal
food
when
it
becomes
available
.
Although
this
is
trivial
most
of
the
time
,
omnivorous
or
herbivorous
birds
,
such
as
sparrows
,
often
will
feed
their
chicks
insects
while
food
is
most
needed
for
-LSB-
23
-RSB-
On
close
inspection
it
appears
that
nectar-feeding
birds
such
as
sunbirds
rely
on
the
ants
and
other
insects
that
they
find
in
flowers
,
not
for
a
richer
supply
of
protein
,
but
for
essential
nutrients
such
as
Cyanocobalamin
that
are
absent
from
nectar
.
Similarly
,
monkeys
of
many
species
eat
maggoty
fruit
,
sometimes
in
clear
preference
to
sound

When
to
refer
to
such
animals

otherwise
