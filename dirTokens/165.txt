a
play
on

-LSB-

-RSB-
The
aim
of
copyleft
is
to
use
the
legal
framework
of
copyright
to
enable
non-author
parties
to
be
able
to
reuse
and
,
in
many
licensing
schemes
,
modify
content
that
is
created
by
an
author
.
Unlike
works
in
the
public
domain
,
the
author
still
maintains
copyright
over
the
material
,
however
the
author
has
granted
a
non-exclusive
license
to
any
person
to
distribute
,
and
often
modify
,
the
work
.
Copyleft
licenses
require
that
any
be
distributed
under
the
same
terms
,
and
that
the
original
copyright
notices
be
maintained
.
A
symbol
commonly
associated
with
copyleft
is
a
reversal
of
the
facing
the
other
way
;
the
opening
of
the

points
