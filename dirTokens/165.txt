copyright
is
a

concept
which
gives
the
author
or
creator
of
a
work
legal
control
over
the
duplication
and
public
performance
of
his
or

work
in
many
jurisdictions
this
is
limited
by
a

the
author
work

only
be
copied

or

performed
with
the
consent
of
the
author
unless
the
use
is
a
traditional
copyright
control
limits
the
use
of
the
work
of
the

to
those
who
either
pay
royalties
to
the
author
for
usage
of
the

content
or
limit
their
use
to
fair
use
secondly
it
limits
the
use
of

whose

it
creates

as

any

copyleft
and
is
a
play
on
the
word
copyright
and
describes
the
practice
of
using
copyright
law
to
remove
restrictions
on
distributing
copies
and
modified
versions
of
a
the
aim
of
copyleft
is
to
use
the
legal
framework
of
copyright
to
enable
parties
to
be
able
to
reuse
and
in
many
licensing
schemes
modify
content
that
is
created
by
an
author
unlike
works
in
the
public
domain
the
author
still
maintains
copyright
over
the
material
however
the
author
has
granted
a
license
to
any
person
to
distribute
and
often
modify
the
work
copyleft
licenses
require
that
any
be
distributed
under
the
same
terms
and
that
the
original
copyright
notices
be
maintained
a
symbol
commonly
associated
with
copyleft
is
a
reversal
of
the
facing
the
other
way
the
opening
of
the
c
points
left
rather
than
right
unlike
the
copyright
symbol
the
copyleft
symbol
does
not
have
a
codified

copyfree

type

licenses

all

however
some
licenses
include
certain
restrictions
and
requirements
which
make

example
copyleft

generally
requires
that
all
derivative
works
be
distributed
under
the
terms
of
the
same
licenses
include
the
simplified
the
open
works
license
and
others
but
not
the

copyleft

the

also
considered
to

all

licenses

licenses
not
all

since
they
may
introduce
limitations
not

definition
the
as
well
as

an
example
of

another
notable
example
is
the

the

the
percentage

may
see

adopted
open

reducing
