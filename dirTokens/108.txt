Roosevelt
Administration
in
of
Stevens
'
first
achievements
in
Panama
was
in
building
and
rebuilding
the
housing
,
cafeterias
,
hotels
,
water
systems
,
repair
shops
,
warehouses
,
and
other
infrastructure
needed
by
the
thousands
of
incoming
workers
.
Stevens
began
the
recruitment
effort
to
entice
thousands
of
workers
from
the
United
States
and
other
areas
to
come
to
the
Canal
Zone
to
work
,
and
tried
to
provide
accommodation
in
which
the
incoming
workers
could
work
and
live
in
reasonable
safety
and
comfort
.
He
also
re-established
and
enlarged
the
railway
that
was
to
prove
crucial
in
transporting
millions
of
tons
of
spoil
from
the
cut
through
the
mountains
to
the
dam
across
the

William
C.
C.
had
been
appointed
chief
sanitation
officer
of
the
canal
construction
project
in
1904
.
Gorgas
implemented
a
range
of
measures
to
minimize
the
spread
of
deadly
diseases
,
particularly
and
malaria
which
had
recently
been
shown
to
be
mosquito-borne
following
the
work
of
Dr.
and
Dr.
There
was
investment
in
extensive
sanitation
projects
,
including
city
water
systems
,
fumigation
of
buildings
,
spraying
of
insect-breeding
areas
with
oil
and
larvicide
,
installation
of
mosquito
netting
and
window
screens
,
and
elimination
of
stagnant
water
.
Despite
opposition
from
the
Commission
-LRB-
one
member
said
his
ideas
were
barmy
-RRB-
,
Gorgas
persisted
and
when
Stevens
arrived
,
he
threw
his
weight
behind
the
project
.
After
two
years
of
extensive
work
,
mosquito-spread
diseases
were
nearly
Nevertheless
,
even
with
all
this

a
U.S.
engineering
panel
was
commissioned
to
review
the
canal
design
,
which
still
had
not
been
finalised
.
It
recommended
to
President
Roosevelt
a
sea-level
canal
,
as
had
been
attempted
by
the
French
.
However
,
in
1906
Stevens
,
who
had
seen
the
Chagres
in
full
flood
,
was
summoned
to
Washington
and
declared
a
sea-level
approach
to
be
`
an
entirely
untenable
proposition
'
.
He
argued
in
favor
of
a
canal
using
a
lock
system
to
raise
and
lower
ships
from
a
large
reservoir

sea
This
would
create
both
the
largest
dam
and
the
largest
man-made
lake
in
the
world
at
that
time
.
The
water
to
refill
the
locks
would
be
taken
from
Gatun
Lake
by
opening
and
closing
enormous
gates
and
valves
and
letting
gravity
propel
the
water
from
the
lake
.
Gatun
Lake
would
connect
to
the
Pacific
through
the
mountains
at
the
Gaillard
-LRB-
Culebra
-RRB-
Cut
.
Stevens
successfully
convinced
Roosevelt
of
the
necessity
and
feasibility
of
the
alternative
construction
of
a
canal
with
locks
required
the
excavation
of
more
than
an
additional
170,000,000
cuyd
3
of
material
over
and
above
the
30,000,000
cuyd
3
excavated
by
the
French
.
As
quickly
as
possible
,
the
Americans
replaced
or
upgraded
the
old
,
unusable
French
equipment
with
new
construction
equipment
that
was
designed
for
a
much
larger
and
faster
scale
of
work
.
About
102
new
large
,
railroad-mounted
were
purchased
and
brought
in
from
the
United
States
.
These
were
joined
by
enormous
steam-powered
cranes
,
giant
hydraulic
dredges
and
pneumatic
power
drills
,
nearly
all
of
which
was
manufactured
by
new
,
extensive
machine-building
technology
developed
and
built
in
the
United
States
.
The
railroad
also
had
to
be
comprehensively
upgraded
with
heavy-duty
,
double-tracked
rails
over

of

to
accommodate

,
the
canal
is
positioned
to
be
a
significant
feature
of

for
the
foreseeable
future
.
However
,
changes
in
shipping
patterns
--
particularly
the

ships
--
will
necessitate
changes
to
the

In

it
was
anticipated
that
by
2011
,
37
%
of
the
world
's
container
ships
would
be
too
large
for
the
present
canal
,
and
hence
a
failure
to
expand
would
result
in
a
significant
loss
of
market
share
.
The
maximum
sustainable
capacity
of
the
present
canal
,
given
some
relatively
minor

work
,
is
estimated
at
330
--
40

The

the
project

double
the

current

for
two
new
flights
of
locks
to
be
built
parallel
to

operated
in
addition
to
,
the
old
locks
:
one
east
of
the
existing
Gatun
locks
,
and
one
southwest
of
the
Miraflores
locks
,
each
supported
by
approach
channels
.
Each
flight
will
ascend
from
sea
level
directly
to
the
level
of
Gatun
Lake
;
the
existing
two-stage
ascent
at
Miraflores
and
Pedro
Miguel
locks
will
not
be
replicated
.
The
new
lock
chambers
will
feature
sliding

channel
at
Miraflores
from

skirting

Lake
.
Each
of
these
channels
will
be
218m
-LRB-
720ft

wide
,
which
will
require
post-Panamax
vessels
to
navigate
the
channels
in
one
direction
at

time
.
The
Gaillard
Cut

the

will
be
widened
to

on
the
straight
portions
and
at
least
366m
-LRB-
1,200

on
the
bends
.
The
maximum
level

will
be
raised
from

-LRB-
1,400
ft
-RRB-
long
and
5.50
m
-LRB-
18ft
-RRB-
deep
.
These
gravity-fed
basins
will
allow
60
%
of
the
water
used
in
each
transit
to
be
reused
;
the
new
locks
will
consequently
use
7
%
less
water
per
transit
than
each
of
the
existing
lock
lanes
.
The
deepening
of
Gatun
Lake
and
the
raising
of
its
maximum
water
level
will
also
provide
capacity
for
significantly
more
water
storage
.
These
measures
are
intended
to
allow
the
expanded
canal
to
operate
without
constructing
new
estimated
cost
of
the
project
is
US$
5.25
billion

The
project
is
designed
to
allow

tons
in

The
expanded
canal
will
have
a
maximum
sustainable
capacity
of
about
600

PC/UMS
tons
per
year
.
Tolls
will

to
