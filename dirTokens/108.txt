edit
having
enjoyed
a
privileged

for

years
the
canal
is
increasingly
facing
competition
from
other
quarters
because
canal
tolls
have
risen
and
as
ships
have
become
larger
some
have
suggested
that
the

now
a
viable
alternative

route

asia
to

the
panama
canal
however
continues
to
serve
more
than

possibly
leading
to
a
diversion
of
some
traffic
to

route
however
such
a
route
is
beset
by
unresolved
territorial
issues

canal
expansion
demand
is
rising
for
efficient
global
shipping
of
goods
the
canal
is
positioned
to
be
a
significant
feature
of
world
shipping
for
the
foreseeable
future
however
changes
in
shipping
patterns
particularly
the
increasing
numbers
of
ships
will
necessitate
changes
to
the
canal
if
it
is
to
retain
a
significant
in
it
was
anticipated
that
by
of
the
world
container
ships
would
be
too
large
for
the
present
canal
and
hence
a
failure
to
expand
would
result
in
a
significant
loss
of
market
share
the
maximum
sustainable
capacity
of
the
present
canal
given
some
relatively
minor
improvement
work
is
estimated
at
million
tons
per
year
it
was
anticipated
that
this
capacity
would
be
reached
between
and
close
to
of
transiting
vessels
were
already
using
the
full
width
of
the
enlargement
scheme
similar
to
the
lock
to
allow
for
a
greater
number
of
transits
and
the
ability
to
handle
larger
ships
has
been
under
consideration
for
some
has
been
approved
by
the
government
of
and
is
in
progress
with
completion
originally
expected
by
the
end
of
the
cost
is
estimated
at
billion
and
the
project
will
double
the
canal
capacity
allowing
more
traffic
and
the
passage
of
longer
and
wider
ships
this
proposal
to
expand
the
canal
was
approved
in
a
by
about
on
october
current
plan
is
for
two
new
flights
of
locks
to
be
built
parallel
to
and
operated
in
addition
to
the
old
locks
one
east
of
the
existing
gatun
locks
and
one
southwest
of
the
miraflores
locks
each
supported
by
approach
channels
each
flight
will
ascend
from
sea
level
directly
to
the
level
of
gatun
lake
the
existing
ascent
at
miraflores
and
pedro
miguel
locks
will
not
be
replicated
the
new
lock
chambers
will
feature
sliding
gates
doubled
for
safety
and
will
be
ft
long
wide
and
m
deep
this
will
allow
the
transit
of
vessels
with
a
beam
of
up
to
an
overall
length
of
up
to
ft
and
a
draft
of
up
to
equivalent
to
a
container
ship
carrying
around
containers
each
m
in
length
new
locks
will
be
supported
by
new
approach
channels
including
a
km
mi
channel
at
miraflores
from
the
locks
to
the
gaillard
cut
skirting
miraflores
lake
each
of
these
channels
will
be
wide
which
will
require
vessels
to
navigate
the
channels
in
one
direction
at
a
time
the
gaillard
cut
and
the
channel
through
gatun
lake
will
be
widened
to
at
least
on
the
straight
portions
and
at
least
ft
on
the
bends
the
maximum
level
of
gatun
lake
will
be
raised
from
m
to
m
flight
of
locks
will
be
accompanied
by
nine
water
reutilization
basins
three
per
lock
chamber
each
basin
being
about
wide
ft
long
and
m
deep
these
basins
will
allow
of
the
water
used
in
each
transit
to
be
reused
the
new
locks
will
consequently
use
less
water
per
transit
than
each
of
the
existing
lock
lanes
the
deepening
of
gatun
lake
and
the
raising
of
its
maximum
water
level
will
also
provide
capacity
for
significantly
more
water
storage
these
measures
are
intended
to
allow
the
expanded
canal
to
operate
without
constructing
new
estimated
cost
of
the
project
is
billion
the
project
is
designed
to
allow
for
an
anticipated
growth
in
traffic
from
million
tons
in
to
nearly
million
tons
in
the
expanded
canal
will
have
a
maximum
sustainable
capacity
of
about
million
tons
per
year
tolls
will
continue
to
be
calculated
based
on
vessel
tonnage
and
will
not
depend
on
the
locks
new
locks
are
expected
to
open
for
traffic
in
the
present
locks
which
will
be
years
old
by
that
time
will
then
be
able
to
give
engineers
greater
access
for
maintenance
and
are
projected
to
continue
