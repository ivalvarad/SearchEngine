However

the

enjoyed
privileges

remained
loyal
to

The

movement

On

a
fleet
of
eight
warships
arrived
in
the
port
of
Paracas
under
the
command
of
general
Jose
de
San
Martin
and
who
was
serving
in
the
Chilean
Navy
.
Immediately
on

they
took
control
of

town

San
Martin
settled
in

November

where
he
established
his
headquarters
while

At

time

was
occupied
by

under

command
of
Gregorio
Escobedo
.
Because
Peru
was
the
stronghold
of
the
Spanish
government
in
South
America
,
San
Martin
's
strategy
to
liberate
Peru
was
to
use
diplomacy
.
He
sent
representatives
to
Lima
urging
the
Viceroy
that
Peru
be
granted
independence
,
however
all
negotiations
proved
San

proclaiming
the
independence
of
