kennedy
received
national
exposure
from

episode
his
father
thought
it
just
as
well
that

die
as
a
compromise
kennedy
also
voted
for

many
civil

advocates
at

kennedy
supported
was
passed

on

boston
lawyer
vincent
celeste
by

wide
margin
it
was

campaign
that
kennedy
press
secretary
at
this
time
put
together
a
film
entitled
senator
john
kennedy
which
exhibited
a
day
in
the
life
of
the
senator
and
showcased
his
family
life
as
well
as
the
of
his
office
it
was
the
most
comprehensive
film
produced
about
kennedy
up
to
that
kennedy

was
a
strong
supporter
of

to
censure
mccarthy
and
kennedy
drafted
a
speech
supporting
the
censure
the
speech
however
was
not
delivered
because
of
kennedy
hospitalization
at
the
time
the
speech
had
the
potential
of
putting
kennedy
in
the
position
of
participating
procedurally
by
pairing
his
vote
against
that
of
another
senator
although
kennedy
never
indicated
how
he
would
have
voted
the

his

kennedy

october
which
ordered
the
withdrawal
of
military
personnel
by
the
end
of

kennedy

not

outlined
a

also
laid
out
a
hopeful

realistic
route
for

peace
at
a
time
when
the

the

for
an

the

wished
to
discuss
a
topic
on

too
often
ignorance
abounds
and
the
truth
is
too
rarely
perceived
yet
it
is
the
most
important
topic
on

world
peace
i
speak
of
peace
because
of
the

in
an
age

a

contains
ten
times
the

the
production

nuclear

in
dimona
which
he

could

of

denied
by

in

the
israeli
knesset
on

that
the
purpose
of
the
nuclear

at
beersheba
was
for
research
in
problems
of
arid
zones

when

kennedy
believed
the

would
anger
many
southern
whites
and
make
it
more
difficult
to
pass
civil

as
lukewarm

concerning
the

martin

kennedy
felt
the

kennedy
called
the

robert

kennedy
initially
proposed
an
overhaul

american
immigration
policy
that
later
was
to
become
the

shifted
the

the
policy
change
also
shifted
the
emphasis

kennedy
wanted
to

he
declined

he
expressed

directed

wiesner
was
strongly
opposed

proved
to
be
adept
at
obtaining

the

kennedy
also
persuaded

to
allow
him
to
delegate
his
chairmanship
of

early
in

kennedy
was
poised
to
dismantle
the
manned

program
but
postponed
any
decision
out
of
deference
to
johnson
who
had
been
a
strong
supporter
of
the
space
program
in
the
kennedy
advisors
speculated
that
a
moon
flight
would
be
prohibitively
and
he
was
considering
plans
to
dismantle
the
apollo
program
due
to
its
kennedy
proposing
a
program
to
land
men
on

to

this
quickly
changed
on

to
fly
in

reinforcing
american
fears
about
being
left
behind
in

competition
with

kennedy
now
became
eager
for
the
to
take
the
lead
in
the
for
reasons
of
strategy
and
prestige
on
april
he
sent
a
memo
to
johnson
asking
him
to
look
into
the
status
of
america
space
program
and
into
programs
that
could
offer
nasa
the
opportunity
to
catch
after
consulting
with
von
johnson
responded
approximately
one
week
later
concluding
that
we
are
neither
making
maximum
effort
nor
achieving
results
necessary
if
this

is
to

concluded
that
a

landing
was
far
enough
in
the
future
that
it
was
likely
the
united
states
would
achieve
it
kennedy
advisor
advised
him
to
support
the
moon
landing
and
on
may
kennedy
announced
the
goal
in
a
speech
titled
message
to
the
congress
on
urgent
national
i
believe
that
this

should
commit
itself
to
achieving
the

before
this

is
out
of
landing
a
man
on
the

and
returning
him
safely
to

no

project
in
this
period
will
be
more
impressive
to

more
important
