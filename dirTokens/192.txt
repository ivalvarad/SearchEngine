a

is
built
around

and
includes
its

one
clause
is

subordinate
clauses
may
function
as

in

the
main
clause
is

conjunction
that
shows

the

but
it
is
often
are
clauses
that
function
as
a

as
well
as

which
can
also
be
in
contrast
to
many
other
germanic
languages
there
is
no
major
differences
between
word
order
in
main

subordinate
verb
articles
and
syntax
relies
on
auxiliary
verbs
for
many
functions
including
the
expression
of
tense
aspect
and
mood
auxiliary
verbs
form
main
clauses
and
the
main
verbs
function
as
heads
of
a
subordinate
clause
of
the
auxiliary
verb
for
example
in
the
sentence
dog
did
not
find
its
the
clause
its
is
the
complement
of
the
negated
verb
is
used
in
many
constructions
including
focus
negation
and
interrogative
verb
do
can
be
used
as
an
auxiliary
even
in
simple
declarative
sentences
where
it
usually
serves
to
add
emphasis
as
in
i
did
shut
the
fridge
however
in
the
negated
and
inverted
clauses
referred
to
above
it
is
used
because
the
rules
of
english
syntax
permit
these
constructions
only
when
an
auxiliary
is
present
does
not
allow
the
addition
of
the
negating
adverb
not
to
an
ordinary
finite
lexical
verb
as
in
know
can
only
be
added
to
an
auxiliary
or
copular
verb
hence
if
there
is
no
other
auxiliary
present
when
negation
is
required
the
auxiliary
do
is
used
to
produce
a
form
like
do
not
do
the
same
applies
in
clauses
requiring
inversion
including
most
questions
inversion
must
involve
the
subject
and
an
auxiliary
verb
so
it
is
not
possible
to
say
you
grammatical
rules
require
you
know
is
done
with
the
adverb
not
which
precedes
the
main
verb
and
follows
an
auxiliary
verb
a
contracted
form
of
not
can
be
used
as
an
enclitic
attaching
to
auxiliary
verbs
and
to
the
copula
verb
just
as
with
questions
many
negative
constructions
require
the
negation
to
occur
with

in
modern
english
do

a

level
the

level
english
tends
to
use
a
structure
where
the
known
information
topic
precedes
the
new
information
comment
because
of
the
strict
svo
syntax
the
topic
of
a
sentence
generally
has
to
be
the
grammatical
subject
of
the
sentence
in
cases
where
the
topic
is
not
the
grammatical
subject
of
the
sentence
frequently
the
topic
is
promoted
to
subject
position
through
syntactic
means
one
way
of
doing
this
is
through
a
passive
construction
girl
was
stung
by
the
another
way
is
through
a
where
the
main
clause
is
demoted
to
be
a
complement
clause
of
a
copula
sentence
with
a
such
as
it
or
there
was
the
girl
that
the
bee
was
a
girl
who
was
stung
by
a
dummy
subjects
are
also
used
in
constructions
where
there
is
no
grammatical
subject
such
as
with
impersonal
verbs
is
or
in
existential
clauses
are
many
cars
on
the
through
the
use
of
these
complex
sentence
constructions
with
informationally
vacuous
subjects
english
is
able
to
maintain
both
a
topic
comment
sentence
structure
and
a
svo
emphasise
a
particular
piece
of
new
or
salient
information
within
a
sentence
generally
through
allocating
the
main
sentence
level
stress
on
the
focal
constituent
for
example
girl
was
stung
by
emphasising
it
was
a
bee
and
not
for
example
a
wasp
that
stung
her
or
was
stung
by
a
contrasting
with
another
possibility
for
example
that
it
was
the
topic
and
focus
can
also
be
established
through
syntactic
dislocation
either
preposing
or
postposing
the
item
to
be
focused
on
relative
to
the
main
clause
for
example

she
was
stung
by
a

the
girl
by
preposition
but
a
similar
effect
could
be
achieved
by
postposition

a

where
reference
to
the

discourse

is
early
studies
of

by
lexicographers
the

were
impeded
by
a
lack
of

from

over

the
dates
of

becomes
formation
forms
new
words
from
existing
words
or
roots
in
its
vocabulary
through
a
variety
of
processes
one
of
the
most
productive
processes
in
english
is
using
a
word
with
a
different
grammatical
role
for
example
using
a
noun
as
a
verb
or
a
verb
as
a
noun
another
productive
process
is
nominal
producing
compound
words
such
as
babysitter
or
or
homesick
a
process
more
common
in
old
english
than
in
modern
english
but
still
productive
in
modern
english
is
the
use
of
derivational
suffixes
hood
ness
ing
ility
to
derive
new
words
from
existing
words
especially
those
of
germanic
origin
or
stems
especially
for
words
of
latin
or
greek
origin
formation
of
new
words
called
neologisms
based
on
greek
or
latin
roots
for
example
television
or
optometry
is
a
highly
productive
process
in
english
and
in
most
modern
european
languages
so
much
so
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
determine
in
which
language
a
neologism
originated
for
this
reason
lexicographer
philip
gove
attributed
many
such
words
to
the
scientific
isv
when
compiling
third
new
international
another
active
process
in
english
is
acronyms
words
formed
by
pronouncing

a
single
word
abbreviations
of
longer
phrases

of

loanwords
by
country
or

of
besides
forming
new
words
from
existing

and
their
roots
also
borrows
words
from
other
languages
this
process
of
adding
words
from
other
languages
is
commonplace
in
many
world
languages
but
english
is
characterised
as
being
especially
open
to
borrowing
of
foreign
words
throughout
the
last
the
most
commonly
used
words
in
english
are
west
the
words

learned
first
by
children
as
they
learn
to
speak
particularly
the
grammatical
words
that
dominate

of
both
spoken
and
written
texts
are
the
germanic
words
inherited
from
the
earliest
periods
of
the
development
of
old
but
one
of
the
consequences
of
long
language
contact
between
french
and
english
in
all
stages
of
their
development
is
that
the
vocabulary
of
english
has
a
very
high
percentage
of
latinate
words
derived
from
french
especially
and
also
from
latin
or
from
other
romance
french

various
periods
of
the

also
borrowed

directly
from

during
all
stages
of
its
many
of
the
words
borrowed
into
english
from
latin
were
earlier
borrowed
into

from
greek
latin
or
greek
are
still
highly
productive
sources
of
stems
used
to
form
vocabulary
of
subjects
learned
in
higher
education
such
as
the
sciences

and
english
continues
to
gain
new
loanwords
and
calques

translations
from

all
over
the
world
and
words
from

other
than
the
ancestral

make
up
about
percent
of
the
vocabulary
of
english
has
formal
and
informal
and
informal
registers
including
child
directed
speech
tend
to
be
made
up
predominantly
of
words
of
origin
while
the
percentage
of
vocabulary
that
is
of
latinate
origin
is
higher
in
legal
scientific
and
academic
loanwords
and
calques
in
other
has
a
strong
influence
on
the
vocabulary
of
other
the
influence
of
english
comes
from
such
factors
as
opinion
leaders
in
other
countries
knowing
the
english
language
the
role
of
english
as
a
world
lingua
franca
and
the
large
number
of
books
and
films
that
are
translated
from
english
into
other
that
pervasive
use
of
english
leads
to
a
conclusion
in
many
places
that
english
is
an
especially
suitable
language
for
expressing
new
ideas
or
describing
new
technologies
among
varieties
of

it
is
especially

that
influences

an

fruitful

the
historically
based
e
as
in
note
and
cake
consequence
of
this
complex
orthographic
history
is
that
learning

can
be
challenging
in

it
can
take
longer
for
school
pupils
to
become

readers
of

than
of
many
other

there
is
an
advantage

of
english
reading
in
learning
the
specific
regularities
that
occur

the

has
caused

traditional

to
recede

a

this

later

there
is
also
considerable
variation
along
lines
of
social
class
and
some
traits
though
exceedingly
common
are
considered
and
are
associated
with
lower

of
this

been
considered
to
have
arisen
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
history
of

however
more
recent
research
has
suggested
that
many
distinctive
southern
features
did
not
become
widespread
until
the
american
vernacular
english
is
also
a
accent
and
some
linguists
ascribe
this
and
other
defining
traits
of
the
variety
to
its
origins
among
enslaved
africans
in
the
american
south
where
english
was
spoken
others
however
ascribe
the
distinguishing
traits
to
substrate
influence
from

languages
spoken
by

had
to
use

a
lingua

a
highly
coherent
and
homogeneous
variety
it
has
often
been
stigmatised
as
a
form
of
broken
or
uneducated
english

today
linguists
recognise
it
as
a
fully
developed
variety
of

its
own
norms

british
english

both

similarly
accents
aside
from
some
accents
in
the
of

they
stand
out
however
for
their
innovative
vowels
many
short
vowels
are
fronted

have
diphthongised
australian
english

a
contrast
between

not
found
in

australian
english

from

in

instances
one
difference
is
the

a
few
characteristics

r
there
are
different
varieties
that
differ
based
on
the
native

of
the
most
phonological
differences
from

are
in
the
consonant
differences
include
the
tendency
to
pronounce
p
t
k
without
aspiration
pin
pronounced
rather
than
as
as
in
most
other
varieties
while
r

often
pronounced
as
a
flap
instead
of

the
more
common
varieties
of

also
spoken
in

to
a
local
variety

the
most
prominent
varieties
are

in
central
america
english

creoles
are
spoken
in

the
caribbean
coasts
of
nicaragua
and
panama
locals
are
often
fluent
both
in
the
local
english
variety
and
the
local
creole
languages
and
between
them
is
frequent
indeed
another
way
to
conceptualise
the
relationship
between
creole
and
standard
varieties
is
to
see
a
spectrum
of
social
registers
with
the
creole
forms
serving
as
basilect
and
the
more
forms
serving
as
the
acrolect
the
most
formal
caribbean
varieties
are
based
on
british
english
and
consequently
most
are
except
for
formal
styles
of
jamaican
english
which
are
often
rhotic
jamaican
english
differs
from
rp
in
its
vowel
inventory
which
has
a
distinction
between
long
and
short
vowels
rather
than
tense
and
lax
vowels
as
in
standard
english
the
diphthongs
ei
and
ou
are
monophthongs
e
and

even
the
reverse
diphthongs
ie

bay
and
boat
pronounced

t
often
word
final
consonant
clusters
are
simplified
so
that
child
is
pronounced

wind
win
a
historical
legacy
tends
to
take
rp
as
its
ideal
and
how
well
this
ideal
is
realised
in
an
individual
speech
reflects
class
distinctions
among
indian
english
speakers
indian
english
accents
are
marked
by
the
pronunciation
of
phonemes
such
as
t

d
often
pronounced

retroflex
articulation
as
and

the
replacement
of
