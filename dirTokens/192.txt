Because

some

ascribe

traits
of

to
its
origins
among
enslaved
Africans
in
the
American
South
where
non-rhotic

Others
however
ascribe
the

English
,

linguists
recognise
it
as
a
fully
developed
variety
of
English
with
its
own
norms
shared

Australian

most
closely

to
British
English
,
and
both
have
similarly
non-rhotic
accents
,
aside
from
some
accents
in
the
of
New

They
stand
out
,
however
,
for
their
innovative
vowels
:
many
short
vowels
are
fronted
or
raised
,
whereas
many
long
vowels
have
diphthongised

Australian
English
also
has
a
contrast
between
long
and
short
vowels

not
found
in
most
other
varieties

Australian

from

SAE
is
a
non-rhotic

,
which

to
follow

as
a
norm
.
It

alone
among
non-rhotic

There
are
different

varieties
that

based
on

of
the
-LSB-
251
-RSB-
Most
phonological
differences
from

are
in
the

Consonant

include
the
tendency
to
pronounce

without

-LRB-
e.g.
/
pin
/
pronounced
-LSB-
pɪn
-RSB-
rather
than
as
-LSB-
pʰɪn
-RSB-
as
in
most
other
varieties
-RRB-
,
while
r
is
often
pronounced
as
a
flap
-LSB-
ɾ
-RSB-
instead
of
as
the
more
common
-LSB-
253
-RSB-
varieties
of
English
are
also
spoken
in
the
Caribbean
Islands
that
were
colonial
possessions
of
Britain
,
including
Jamaica
,
and
the
Leeward
and
and
and
Barbados
the
and
Belize
Each
of
these
areas
are
home
both
to
a
local
variety
of
English
and
a
local
English
based
creole
,
combining
English
and
African
languages
.
The
most
prominent
varieties
are
and
In
Central
America
,
English
based
creoles
are
spoken
in
on
the
Caribbean
coasts
of
Nicaragua
and
Panama
.
-LSB-
254
-RSB-
Locals
are
often
fluent
both
in
the
local
English
variety
and
the
local
creole
languages
and
code-switching
between
them
is
frequent
,
indeed
another
way
to
conceptualise
the
relationship
between
Creole
and
Standard
varieties
is
to
see
a
spectrum
of
social
registers
with
the
Creole
forms
serving
as
``
basilect
''
and
the
more
RP-like
forms
serving
as
the
``
acrolect
''
,
the
most
formal
-LSB-
255
-RSB-
Caribbean
varieties
are
based
on
British
English
and
consequently
most
are
non-rhotic
,
except
for
formal
styles
of
Jamaican
English
which
are
often
rhotic
.
Jamaican
English
differs
from
RP
in
its
vowel
inventory
,
which
has
a
distinction
between
long
and
short
vowels
rather
than
tense
and
lax
vowels
as
in
Standard
English
.
The
diphthongs
/
ei
/
and
/
ou
/
are
monophthongs
-LSB-
e
:]
and
-LSB-
o
:]
or
even
the
reverse
diphthongs
-LSB-
ie
-RSB-
and
-LSB-
uo
-RSB-
-LRB-
e.g.
bay
and
boat
pronounced
-LSB-
bʲe
:]
and
-LSB-
bʷo
:
t
-RSB-
Often
word
final
consonant
clusters
are
simplified
so
that
``
child
''
is
pronounced
-LSB-
t͡ʃail
-RSB-
and
``
wind
''
-LSB-
win
-RSB-
.
-LSB-

-RSB-
-LSB-
258
-RSB-
a
historical
legacy
,
tends
to
take
RP
as
its
ideal
,
and
how
well
this
ideal
is
realised
in
an
individual
's
speech
reflects
class
distinctions
among
Indian
English
speakers
.
Indian
English
accents
are
marked
by
the
pronunciation
of
phonemes
such
as
/
t
/
and
/
d
/
-LRB-
often
pronounced
with
retroflex
articulation
as
-LSB-
ʈ
-RSB-
and
-LSB-
ɖ
-RSB-
and
the
replacement
of
/
θ
/
and
/
ð
/
with
dentals
-LSB-
t̪
-RSB-
and
-LSB-
d̪
-RSB-
Sometimes
Indian
English
speakers
may
also
use
spelling
based
pronunciations
where
the
silent
h
found
in
words
such
as
ghost
is
pronounced
as
an
Indian
stop
