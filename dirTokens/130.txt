subspecies
abbreviated
subsp
or

plural
subspecies
is
either
a
subordinate
to
species
or
a
in
that
rank
a
subspecies
can
not
be
recognized
in
isolation
a
species
will
either
be
recognized
as
having
no
subspecies

all

two
or
more

any
that

the
subspecies

the
only
taxonomic
rank
below

of

that
can
receive
a
name
under
the
code
of

for
algae
fungi
and
other
infraspecific
ranks
such

variety
may
be
named
in
bacteriology
there
are
recommendations
but
not
strict
requirements
for
recognizing
other
important
infraspecific
taxonomist
decides
whether
to
recognize
a
subspecies
or
not
a
common
way
to
decide
is
that
organisms
belonging
to
different
subspecies
of
the
same
species
are
capable
of
interbreeding
and
producing
fertile
offspring
but
they
do
not
interbreed
in
nature
due
to
or
other
factors
the
differences
between
subspecies
are
usually
less
distinct
than

differences

zoology
the
code
of

edition
accepts
only
one
rank
below
that
of
species
namely
the
rank
of
other
groupings
infrasubspecific
entities
do
not
have
names
regulated
by

such
forms
have
no
official

status
though
they
may
be
useful
in
describing
altitudinal
or
geographical
clines
pet
breeds
while
the
scientific
name
of
a
species
is
a
binomen
the
scientific
name
of
a
subspecies
is
a
trinomen
a
binomen
followed
by
a
subspecific

the
only
rank
below
species
that
is
regulated
explicitly
by
the
code

is
subspecies
but
infrasubspecific
taxa
are
extremely
important
in
bacteriology
appendix
of
the
code
lays
out
some
recommendations
that
are
intended
to
encourage
uniformity
in

when

the

subspecies

zoologists
disagree
over
whether
a
certain
population
is
a
subspecies
or
a
full
species
the
species
name
may
be
written
in
parentheses
thus
argentatus
means
the

the
notation
within
the
parentheses
means
that
some
consider
it
a
subspecies
of
a
larger
species
and
therefore
call
it
argentatus

others
consider
it
