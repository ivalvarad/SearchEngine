early
origins
of
the

go
back
to
the
late
1910s
,
when
numerous
cantonal
farmers

parties
where
founded
in
agrarian
Protestant
German-speaking
parts
of
Switzerland
.
While
the
Democratic
had
earlier
been
a
popular
party
for
farmers
,
this
changed
during
War
when
the
party
had
mainly
defended
the
interests
of
industrialists
and

When

introduced
in
1919
,
the
new

parties
won
significant
electoral
support
,
especially
in
Zürich
and
Bern
and
eventually
also
gained
representation
in
parliament
and
-LSB-

By
1929

the

of

had
gained
enough
influence
to

level

called
the

and
-LRB-
BGB
-RRB-
.
During
the
1930s
,
the
BGB
entered
the
mainstream
of
Swiss
politics
as
a
right-wing
conservative
party
in
the
bourgeois
bloc
.
While
the
party
opposed
any
kind
of
socialist
ideas
such
as
internationalism
and
anti-militarism
it
sought
to
represent
local
Swiss

and
farmers
against

strongly
to
the
establishment
of
the
Swiss
national
ideology
known
as
the

Spiritual

of
the
Nation
-RRB-
,
which
was
largely
responsible
for
the
growing
Swiss
sociocultural
and
political
cohesion
from
the
1930s
.
In
the
party
's
fight
against
left-wing
ideologies
,
sections
of
party
officials
and
farmers
voiced
understanding
,
or
failed
to
distance
themselves
from

the
BGB
contributed
to
the
establishment
of
the
characteristic
Swiss
post-war
consensual
politics
,
social
agreements
and

policies
.

The
Democratic
Party
had
been
supported
particularly
by
workers
,
and
the
SVP
sought
to
expand
its
electoral
base
towards
these
,
as
the
traditional
BGB
base
in
the
rural
population
had
started
to
lose
its
importance
in
the
post-war
era
.
As
the
Democratic
Party
had
represented
centrist
social-liberal
positions
,
the
course
of
the
SVP
shifted
towards
the
political
centre

the

as
the
former
BGB
throughout
the
post-war

Internal
debates
continued
,
and
the
1980s
saw
growing
conflicts
between
the
Bern
and
Zürich
cantonal
branches

the
former

represented
the

faction

his

to
oversee
significant

in
the
political
line
of
the
Zürich

,
bringing
an
end
to
debates
that
aimed
to
open
the
party
up
to
a
wide
array
of

.
Blocher
soon
consolidated
his

in

,

The

the
establishment
of
a
cantonal

in
1977
,
as
well
as
political
training
courses
.
The
ideology
of
the
Zürich
branch
was
also
reinforced
,
and
the
rhetoric
hardened
,
which
resulted
in
the
best
election
result
for
the
Zürich

in
fifty
years
in
the

an
increase
from
11.3

This
was

of

continued
into
the

While
the
Bern-oriented

represented
the
old

the
Zürich-oriented
wing
led
by

represented
a
new

.
The

This

the

thus
formed
the
first

group
in

since
the
-LSB-

2008
,
the
SVP
demanded
that
Widmer-Schlumpf
resign
from
the
Federal
Council
and
leave
the
party
.
When
she
refused
,
the
SVP
demanded
that
its
Grisons
branch
expel
her
.
Since
Swiss
parties
are
legally
federations
of
cantonal
parties
,
the
federal
SVP
could
not
expel
her
itself
.
The
Grisons
branch
stood
by
Widmer-Schlumpf
,
leading
the
SVP
to
expel
it
from
the
party
.
Shortly
afterward

branch
reorganised
itself

a
2.3-point
decrease
from

This
loss
could
be
partly
attributed
to
the
split
of
the

which
gained
5.4

and
criticises
the
high

foreigners
among

According

the
opinion
of

such
