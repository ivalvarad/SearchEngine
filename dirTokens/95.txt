early
origins
of
the
svp
go
back
to
the
late
when
numerous
cantonal
farmers
parties
where
founded
in
agrarian
protestant
parts
of
switzerland
while
the
democratic
had
earlier
been
a
popular
party
for
farmers
this
changed
during
war
when
the
party
had
mainly
defended
the
interests
of
industrialists
and
consumer
when
was
introduced
in
the
new
farmers
parties
won
significant
electoral
support
especially
in
and
bern
and
eventually
also
gained
representation
in
parliament
and
by
the
coalition
of
farmers
parties
had
gained
enough
influence
to
get
one
of
their
leaders
elected
to
the
federal
a
representative
party
was
founded
on
the
national
level
called
the
of
farmers
traders
and
bgb
during
the
the
bgb
entered
the
mainstream
of
swiss
politics
as
a
conservative
party
in
the
bourgeois
bloc
while
the
party
opposed
any
kind
of
socialist
ideas
such
as
internationalism
and
it
sought
to
represent
local
swiss
traders
and
farmers
against
big
business
and
international
bgb
contributed
strongly
to
the
establishment
of
the
swiss
national
ideology
known
as
the
spiritual
defence
of
the
nation
which
was
largely
responsible
for
the
growing
swiss
sociocultural
and
political
cohesion

sections
of
party
officials
and
farmers
voiced
understanding
or
failed
to
distance
themselves
from
the
emerging
fascist
after

the
bgb
contributed
to
the
establishment
of
the
characteristic
swiss
consensual
politics
social
agreements
and
economic
growth
policies
the
party
continued
to
be

political

the
bgb
changed
its
name
to
the
swiss

party
svp
after
it
merged
with
the
from
glarus

the
democratic
party
had
been
supported
particularly
by
workers
and
the
svp
sought
to
expand
its
electoral
base
towards
these
as
the
traditional
bgb
base
in
the
rural
population

started
to
lose
its
importance
in
the
era
as
the
democratic
party
had
represented
centrist
positions
the
course
of
the
svp
shifted
towards
the
political
centre

new

however
continued
to
see
its
level
of
support
at
around
the
same
as
the
former
bgb
throughout
the
era
internal
debates
continued
and
the
saw
growing
conflicts
between
the
bern
and
cantonal
branches
where
the
former
branch
represented
the
centrist
faction

the
latter
looked
to
put
new
issues

the
young
entrepreneur
was
elected
president
of
the
svp
in
he
declared
his
intent
to
oversee
significant
change
in
the
political
line
of
the
svp
bringing
an
end
to
debates
that
aimed
to
open
the
party
up
to
a
wide
array
of
opinions
blocher
soon
consolidated
his
power
in
and
began
to
renew
the
organisational
structures
activities
campaigning
style
and
political
agenda
of
the
local
the
young
members
of

party
was
boosted
with
the
establishment
of
a
cantonal
jsvp
in
as
well
as
political
training
courses
the
ideology
of
the
branch
was
also
reinforced
and
the
rhetoric
hardened
which
resulted
in
the
best
election
result
for
the
branch
in
fifty
years
in
the
federal
with
an
increase
from

this
was
contrasted

represented

moderate
style
the
wing
led
by
christoph
blocher
represented
a
new
radical
agenda
the

began
to
politicise
asylum
issues
and
the
question
of

to
dominate
swiss

also
adopted
more
confrontational
the
followingly
started
to
gain
ground
in
the
party
at
the
expense
of

the
party
became
increasingly
centralised
as
a
national
party
in
contrast
to
the
traditional
swiss
system
of
parties
with
loose
organisational
structures
and
weak

a

gathering
a

its
immigration
policy
the

commits
itself
to

the
svp
warns

criticises

according
to
the
opinion
of
the
party
such

amount
to
waste

numerous
svp

have
shown
themselves
to

became
an
amendment
to

key
concern

what
it
alleges

an
increasing
influence
of
the
judiciary
on
politics
according
to
the
svp
this
influence
especially
through
increasingly

the

international
law
which
according

the
svp
is
not
democratically
legitimate
shall
always
be
subordinate
to

the
svp
also
criticises
the
judiciary
as
undemocratic
because
the
courts
have
made
decisions
against
the
will
of
the
majority
therefore
the
svp
promotes
the
preservation
of
voting
procedures
in
the
question

the
naturalization

after
a
federal
court
