arboreal
is
a
rodent
species
of
the
family
cricetidae
it
is
found
in
a
variety
of
habitats
including
dense
forest
in
bolivia
and
peru
at
elevations
from
to
metres
to
ft
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
andes
the
species
is
at
least
partly
arboreal
it
is
distinguished
from
the
arboreal
the
only
other
known
member
of
rhagomys
by
spiny

adult
arboreal
mouse
weighs
in
the
range
to
to
oz
and
has
a
tail
that
is
nearly
as
long
as
the
length
the
fur
is
short
and
dense
and
consists
of
a
mixture
of
long
slender
hairs
and
spines
giving
the
mouse
a
bristly
appearance
the
upper
parts
are
and
the
underparts
are
with
fewer
spines
the
tail
is
dark
above
and
slightly
paler
below
with
rings
of
scales
and
hairs
increasing
in
length
towards
the
tip
and
ending
with
a
tuft
of
hairs
the
fore
feet
have
five
long
digits
with
broad
blunt
tips
and
short
narrow
claws
that
hardly
project
beyond
the
tips
of
the
digits
the
hind
feet
are
short
and
broad
and
have
five
digits
with
blunt
calloused
tips
the
hallux
big
toe
being
shorter
than
the
others
and
having
a
nail
rather
than
a
claw
the
female
has
three

on
the
eastern
slopes
of
the
andes
in
south

the
sites
are

mouse
is
probably
an
insectivore
examination
of
the
stomach
contents
showed
that
the
diet
includes
flies
ants
and
moths
and
the
short
gut
and
crested
teeth
reinforce
this
hypothesis
the
morphology
of
the
feet
the
eyes
and
the
short
snout
make
it
likely
that
it
is
an
arboreal
species
three
of
the
specimens
examined
were
caught
in
and
the
fourth
one
was
a
metre
above
the
ground
in
a
clump
of
bamboo
the
noticeably
long
tongue
may
be
used
to
extract
insects
from
crevices
but
very
little
is
known
of
this
animal
and
its
natural
status
edit
only
known
from
a
few
isolated
records
is
listed
by
the
union
for
conservation
of
as
being
of
this
is
because
of
its
tolerance
of
several
types
of
habitats
and
because
in
the
absence
of
any
particular
threats
it
seems
unlikely
that
it
is
declining
at
a
sufficient
rate
to
qualify
for
being
included
in
a
more
threatened
