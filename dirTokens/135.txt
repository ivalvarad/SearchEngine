mouse
weighs
in
the
range
25
to

-LRB-
0.88
to
1.23
oz
-RRB-
and
has
a
tail
that
is
nearly
as
long
as
the
head-and-body
length
.
The
fur
is
short
and
dense
,
and
consists
of
a
mixture
of
long
slender
hairs
and
spines
,
giving
the
mouse
a
bristly
appearance
.
The
upper
parts
are
olive-brown
and
the
underparts
are
buffish-ochre
with
fewer
spines
.
The
tail
is
dark
above
and
slightly
paler
below
,
with
rings
of
scales
,
and
hairs
increasing
in
length
towards
the
tip
and
ending
with
a
tuft
of
hairs
.
The
fore
feet
have
five
long
digits
with
broad
,
blunt
tips
and
short
,
narrow
claws
that
hardly
project
beyond
the
tips
of
the
digits
.
The
hind
feet
are
short
and
broad
and
have
five
digits
with
blunt
,
calloused
tips
,
the

being
shorter
than
the
others
and
having
a
nail
rather
than
a
claw

insectivore
Examination
of
the
stomach
contents
showed
that
the
diet
includes
flies
,
ants
and
moths
,
and
the
short
gut
and
crested
teeth
reinforce
this
hypothesis
.
The
morphology
of
the
feet
,
the
forward-pointing
eyes
and
the
short
snout
make
it
likely
that
it
is
an
arboreal
species
.
Three
of
the
specimens
examined
were
caught
in
and
the
fourth
one
was
a
metre

the
ground
,
in
a
clump
of
bamboo

The

This
is
because
of
its
tolerance
of
several
types
of
habitats
,
and
because
in
the
absence
of
any

threats
,
it
seems
unlikely
that
it

for
