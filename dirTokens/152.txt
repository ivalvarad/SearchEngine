science
is
the
methodical
study
of
nature
including
testable
explanations
and
predictions
an
older
and
closely
related
current
meaning
emerged
from
aristotle
whereby
science
referred
to
the
body
of
reliable
knowledge
that
is
logically
and
rationally
explained
and
etymology
science
as
a
type
of
knowledge
was
closely
linked
to
philosophy
in
the
west
during
the
modern
the
words
science
and
philosophy
were
sometimes
used
interchangeably
not
until
the
century
did
natural
philosophy
emerge
as
a
separate
branch
of
philosophy
which
is
today
called
natural
science
science
continued
to
denote
reliable
knowledge
about
a
topic
it
remains
in
use
in
modern
terms
such
as
or
the
term
science
refers
to
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
not
the
knowledge
itself
it
is
often
synonymous
with
natural
and
physical
science
and
often
restricted
to
those
branches
of
study
relating
to
the
phenomena
of
the
material
universe
and
their
laws
although
the
term
implies
exclusion
of
pure
mathematics
many
university
faculties
include
mathematics
departments
within
their
faculty
of
science
the
dominant
sense
in
ordinary
use
has
a
narrower
use
for
the
term
science
it
developed
as
a
part
of
science
becoming
a
distinct
enterprise
of
defining
the
of
early
examples
include
kepler
laws
galileo
laws
and
newton
of
in
this
period
it
became
more
common
to
refer
to
natural
philosophy
as
natural
science
over
the
course
of
the
century
the
word
science
became
increasingly
associated
with
the
of
the
natural
world
including
physics
chemistry
geology
and
biology
this
sometimes
left
the
study
of
human
thought
and
society
in
a
linguistic
limbo
which
was
resolved
by
classifying
these
areas
of
academic
study
as
for
example
psychology
evolved
from
philosophy
and
has
grown
into
an
area
of

are
both
hard
biological
psychology
and
soft

fields

the

a
result
and
as
is
consistent
with
the
unfolding
of
the
study
of
knowledge
and
development
of
methods
to
establish
facts
each
area
of
psychology
employs
a
scientific
method
reflecting
the
evolution
of
the
development
of
knowledge
and
established
facts
and
the
use
of
the
scientific
method
