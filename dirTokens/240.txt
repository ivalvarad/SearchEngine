the
late
1990s
the
web
portal
was
a
web
IT
buzzword
.
After
the
proliferation
of
in
the
late-1990s
many
companies
tried
to
build
or
acquire
a
portal
to
attempt
to
obtain
a
share
of
an
Internet
market
.
The
web
portal
gained
special
attention
because
it
was
,
for
many
users
,
the
starting
point
of
their
web
browsing
if
it
was
set
as
their
home
page
.
The
content
and
branding
of
a
portal
could
change
as
internet
companies
merged
or
were
acquired
.
Netscape

a

Disney

personal

is
a
web

web
site
on
the
Wide
or
a
local
HTML
home
page
including
JavaScript
and
perhaps
running
in
a
modified
web
browser
.
A
personal
portal
typically
provides
personalized
capabilities
to
its
visitors
or
its
local
user
,
providing
a
pathway
to
other
content
.
It
may
be
designed
to
use
different
numbers
and
types
of
middleware
and
hardware
to
provide
services
from
a
number
of
different
sources
and
may
run
on
a
non-standard
local
web
server
.
In
addition
,
business
portals
can
be
designed
for
sharing
and
collaboration
in
workplaces

A
further
business-driven
requirement
of
portals
is
that
the
content
be
presented
on
multiple
platforms
such
as

Personal
portals
can
be
related
to
any
specific
topic
such
as
providing
friend
information
on
a
social
network
or
providing
links
to
outside
content
that
may
help
others

are

simply
providing

Within

,
early

by
much
more
powerful
``

designs

Some
also
have
relied
on
newer
protocols

popularity

a

of
companies
began
offering
them
as

The
hosted
portal
market
fundamentally
changed
the
composition
of
portals
.
In
many
ways
they
served
simply
as
a
tool
for
publishing
information
instead
of
the
loftier
goals
of
integrating
legacy
applications
or
presenting
correlated
data
from
distributed

.
The
early
hosted
portal
companies
such
as
Hyperoffice.com
or
the
now
defunct

focused
on
collaboration
and

in
addition
to
the
distribution
of
corporate

has
grown

automatically
personalize
the

to

In
