the
late
1990s
the
web
portal
was
a
web
IT
buzzword
.
After
the
proliferation
of
in
the
late-1990s
many
companies
tried
to
build
or
acquire
a
portal
to
attempt
to
obtain
a
share
of
an
Internet
market
.
The
web
portal
gained
special
attention
because
it
was
,
for
many
users
,
the
starting
point
of
their
web
browsing
if
it
was
set
as
their
home
page
.
The
content
and
branding
of
a
portal
could
change
as
internet
companies
merged
or
were
acquired

Netscape

a

Disney

Go.com

others

personal

is
a
web

web
site
on
the
Wide
or
a
local
HTML
home
page
including
JavaScript
and
perhaps
running
in
a
modified
web
browser
.
A
personal
portal
typically
provides
personalized
capabilities
to
its
visitors
or
its
local
user
,
providing
a
pathway
to
other
content
.
It
may
be
designed
to
use
different
numbers
and
types
of
middleware
and
hardware
to
provide
services
from
a
number
of
different
sources
and
may
run
on
a
non-standard
local
web
server
.
In
addition
,
business
portals
can
be
designed
for
sharing
and
collaboration
in
workplaces
.
A
further
business-driven
requirement
of
portals
is
that
the
content
be
presented
on
multiple
platforms
such
as

Information

examples
of

Personal
portals
can
be
related
to
any
specific
topic
such
as
providing
friend
information
on
a
social
network
or
providing
links
to
outside
content
that
may
help
others

are

simply
providing

Within
enterprises
,
early

were
often
replaced
by
much
more
powerful
``

designs
.
Some
also
have
relied
on
newer
protocols
such
as
some

a

of
companies
began
offering
them
as

The
hosted
portal
market
fundamentally
changed
the
composition
of
portals
.
In
many
ways
they
served
simply
as
a
tool
for
publishing
information
instead
of
the
loftier
goals
of
integrating
legacy
applications
or
presenting
correlated
data
from
distributed

.
The
early
hosted
portal
companies
such
as
Hyperoffice.com
or
the
now
defunct

focused
on
collaboration
and

in
addition
to
the
distribution
of
corporate

has
grown

automatically
personalize
the

to

In
