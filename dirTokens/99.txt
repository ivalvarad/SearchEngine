card

then
write

cheque
such
cards
were
generally
phased

replaced

enacted
laws

a
physical
cheque

countries

took
the

additional

to

for

a
signature
of
the
drawer
was
required
to
authorise
the
cheque
and
this
is
the
main
way
to
authenticate
the
cheque
second
it
became
customary
to
write
the
amount
in
words
as
well
as
in
numbers
to
avoid
mistakes
and
make
it
harder
to
fraudulently
alter
the
amount
after
the
cheque
had
been
written
it
is
not
a
legal
requirement
to
write
down
the
amount
in

some
banks
will
refuse
to
accept
cheques
that
do
not

was
added
and
cheques
may
not

a
cheque
is
typically
valid
for
six
months
after
the
date
of

after
which
it
is
a

this
depends
on
where
the
cheque
is
drawn
in
australia
this
is
typically
fifteen
a
cheque

has

or

illegal
in
some
countries
conversely
an
has
an
issue
date
in
the
cheque
number
was
added
and
cheque
books
were
issued
so
that
cheque
numbers
were
sequential
this
allowed
for
some
basic
fraud
detection
by
banks
and
made
sure
one
cheque
was
not
presented
some
countries
such
as
the
us
cheques
contain
a
memo
line
where
the
purpose
of
the
cheque
can
be
indicated
as
a
convenience
without
affecting
the
official
parts
of

this

are
sometimes

at
the
top
when
cheque
oriented
vertically
of
the
reverse
side
of
the
cheque
there
are
usually
one
or
more
blank
lines
labelled
something
like
endorse

the
machine
readable
routing
and
account
information
was
added
to
the
bottom
of
cheques
in
micr
format
this
allowed
automated
sorting
and
routing
of
cheques
between
banks
and
led
to
automated
central
clearing
facilities
the
information
provided
at
the
bottom
of
the
cheque
is
country
specific
and
is
driven
by
each
country
cheque
clearing
system
this
meant
that
the
payee
no
longer
had
to
go
to
the
bank
that
issued
the
cheque
instead
they
could
deposit
it
at
their
own
bank
or
any
other
banks
and
the
cheque
would
be
routed
back
to
the
originating
bank
and
funds
transferred
to
their

bank
additional
protection
a
cheque
can
be
crossed
which
restricts
the
use
of
the
cheque
so
that
the
funds
must
be
paid
into
a
bank
account
the
format
and
wording
varies
from
country
to
country
but
generally
two
parallel
lines
may
be
placed
either
vertically
across
the
cheque
or
in
the
top
left
hand
corner
in
addition
the
words
or
bearer
must
not
be
used
or
if

the
cheque
must
be
crossed
out
on
the
payee
line
if
the
cheque
is
crossed
with
the
words
account
payee
or
similar
then
the
cheque
can
only
be
paid
into
the
bank
account
of
the
person
initially
named
as
the
payee
thus
it
can
not
be
endorsed
to
a
different
edit
stubs
may
be
retained
as
a
record
of
the
cheque
being
sometimes
include
additional
documents
a
page
in
a
chequebook
may
consist
of
both
the
cheque
itself
and
a
stub
or
counterfoil
when
the
cheque
is
written
only
the
cheque
itself
is
detached
and
the
stub
is
retained
in

as
a
record

alternatively
cheques
may
be
recorded
in
a

such

about

the

set
up
a

look
at

clearing
cycle
their
acknowledged
that

that

cycle
could
not

justified
considering

was
declining
however
they
concluded
the
biggest
problem
was
the
unlimited
time
a
bank
could
take
to
dishonor
a
cheque
to
address
this
changes
were
implemented
so
that
the
maximum
time
after

that

was
six
days
