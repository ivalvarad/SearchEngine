In
some
cases
,
the
payee
will
take
the
cheque
to
a
branch
of
the

bank
,
and
cash
the
cheque
there
.
If
a

is

bank

or
the
drawee
bank
returns
the
cheque
to
the
bank
that
it
was
deposited
at

because
there
are
insufficient
funds
for
the
cheque
to
clear
,
it
is
said
that
the
cheque
has
been
dishonoured
Once
a
cheque
is
approved
and
all
appropriate
accounts
involved
have
been
credited
,
the
cheque
is
stamped
with
some
kind
of
cancellation
mark
,
such
as
a
``

The

as
proof
of

or
go

or
be

if

concerns
about
the
amount
of
time
it
took
banks
to
clear
cheques
,
the
United
Kingdom
of
Fair
set
up
a
working
group
in
2006
to
look
at
the
cheque
clearing
cycle
.
Their
-LSB-
21
-RSB-
acknowledged
that
clearing
times
could
be
improved
,
but
that
the
costs
associated
with
speeding
up
the
cheque
clearing
cycle
could
not
be
justified
considering
the
use
of
cheques
was
declining
.
However
,
they
concluded
the
biggest
problem
was
the
unlimited
time
a
bank
could
take
to
dishonor
a
cheque
.
To
address
this
,
changes
were
implemented
so
that
the
maximum
time
after
a
cheque
was
deposited
that
it
could
be
dishonoured
was
six
days
,
what
was
known
as
the
``
certainty
of
fate
''
principle
;
see
and
Credit

and
advantage
to
the
drawer
of
using
cheques
instead
of
transactions
,
is
that
they
know
the
drawer
's
bank
will
not
release
the
money
until
several
days
later
.
Paying
with
a
cheque
and
making
a
deposit
before
it
clears
the
drawer
's
bank
is
called
kiting
or
``
floating
''
and
is
generally
illegal
in
the
US
,
but
rarely
enforced
unless
the
drawer
uses
multiple
chequing
accounts
with
multiple
institutions
to
increase
the
delay
or
to

increasingly
preferred

and
for

,
where
the
decline
has
been
accelerated
by
the

of

and
Being
paper-based
,
cheques
are
costly
for
banks
to
process
in
comparison
to
electronic
payments
,
so
banks
in
many
countries
now
discourage
the
use
of
cheques
,
either
by
charging
for
cheques
or
by
making
the
alternatives
more
attractive
to
customers
.
Cheques
are
also
more
costly
for
the

The

means
that
small

most
European
countries
,
cheques
are
now
rarely
used
,
even
for
third
party
payments
.
In
these
countries
,
it
is
standard
practice
for
businesses
to
publish
their
bank
details
on
invoices
,
to
facilitate
the
receipt
of
payments
by
giro
Even
before
the
introduction
of
online
banking
,
it
has
been
possible
in
some
countries
to
make
payments
to
third
parties
using
ATMs
which
may
accurately
and
rapidly
capture
invoice
amounts
,
due
dates
,
and
payee
bank
details
via
a
bar

to
reduce

In
some
countries
,
entering
the
bank
account
number
results
in
the
bank
revealing
the
name
of
the
payee
as
an
added
safeguard
against
fraud
.
In
using
a
cheque
,
the
onus
is
on
the
payee
to
initiate
the
payment
,
whereas
with
a
giro
transfer
,
the
onus
is
on
the
payer
to
effect

The
writer
of
a
paper
cheque
is
pushing
on
a
rope
:
he
can
not
force
money
out
of
his
own
account
and
into
the
destination
's
account
.
By
writing
the
paper
cheque
,
he
is
handing
the
far
end
of
the
rope
to
the
payee
,
who
will
pull
in
his
own
good
time
.
In
contrast
,
giro
is
more
akin
to
wire
transfer
,
in
that
the
payer
pushes
his
money
away
towards
the
payee
-RRB-
.
The
process
is
also
procedurally
more
simple
,
as

are

to
have
been
posted

Netherlands
,
Belgium
,
and
Scandinavia
,
cheques
have
almost
completely
vanished
in
favour
of
direct
bank
transfers
and
electronic
payments
.
Direct
bank
transfers
,
using
so-called
giro
transfers
,
have
been
standard
procedure
since
the
1950s
to
send
and
receive
regular
payments
like
rent
and
wages
and
even
mail-order
invoices
.
In
the
Netherlands
,
Austria
,
and
Germany
,
all
kinds
of
invoices
are
commonly
accompanied
by
so-called
acceptgiros
-LRB-
Netherlands
-RRB-
or
Überweisungen
-LRB-
German
-RRB-
,
which
are
essentially
standardised
bank
transfer
order
forms
preprinted
with
the
payee
's
account
details
and
the
amount
payable
.
The
payer
fills
in
his
account
details
and
hands
the
form
to
a
clerk
at
his
bank
,
which
will
then
transfer
the
money
.
It
is
also
very
common
to
allow
the
payee
to
automatically
withdraw
the
requested
amount
from
the
payer
's
account

-RRB-
or

.
Though
similar
to
paying
by
cheque
,
the
payee
only
needs
the
payer
's
bank
and
account
number
.
Since
the
early
1990s
,
this
method
of
payment
has
also
been
available
to
merchants
.
Due
to
this
,
credit
cards
are
rather
uncommon
in
Germany
,
Austria
and
the
Netherlands
,
and
are
mostly
used
to
give
access
to
credit
rather
than
as
a
payment
mechanism
.
However
,
debit
cards
are
widespread
in
these
countries
,
since
virtually
all
Austrian
,
German
and
Dutch
banks
issue
debit
cards
instead
of
simple
for
use
on
current
accounts
.
Acceptance
of
cheques
has
been
further
diminished
since
the
late
1990s
,
because
of
the
abolition
of

Cashing

which

exclusively
electronically
initiated
either
via
internet
banking
or
payment
machines
located
at

and

malls

All

Electronic

inexpensive
--
usually
free
for
the

some

partly
because

however

are
increasing
in
popularity
.
Since
2001
,
businesses
in
the
United
Kingdom
have
made
more
electronic
payments
than
cheque
payments
.
Automated

rose
from

in

to
1.1

there
was
still
wide
usage
of
cheques
as
payment
method
in
trade
,
and
also
by
individuals
when
paying
other
individuals
or
for
paying
utility
bills
.
One
of
the
reasons
was
that
banks
usually
provided
cheques
for

their
individual

Electronic

transfer
continued
to

in
India
and
like
other
countries
this
has
caused
a
subsequent
reduction
in
volumes
of

by

this

only

,
almost
all
of
this
for

transactions
.
Personal

A
number
of
measures
have
been
introduced
to
combat
fraud
over
the
years
.
These
range
from
things
like
writing
a
cheque
so
it
is
difficult
to
alter
after
it
is
drawn
,
to
mechanisms
like
crossing
a

of

such
as

as

method
and
not
knowing
if
funds
will
be
received
until
the

This

will

Cheques
are
usually
dishonoured
because

or
because
there
are

in

such
an
act
is

person
issuing

for
an
explanation
as
to
why
the
cheque
was
not

This
wording
was
brought
in
after
a
bank
was
successfully
sued
for
libel
after
returning
a
cheque
with
the
phrase
``

after

there
