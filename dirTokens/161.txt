terminology
associated

other

acclimatized

this

the

invasive
refers
only
to
those
species
that
in
addition
to
becoming

spread
beyond
the
place
of
introduction
for
practical
purposes
this
term
is

only
to
those

that

and
most
widely

sense
an

is
synonymous
with

therefore
applies

to
most
garden

these
adequately
fit
the
basic

some
sources
add
to
that
basic
definition
and
are
now
reproducing
in

from

as

all
of
those

raised

in

that
do
not

without

although
perhaps
lacking
ecological

is
more

has
been
intentionally
or
inadvertently
brought
into
a
region
or
area
also
called

exotic
or
introduction
of
a
species
outside

is
all
that
is
required
to
be
qualified
as
an
introduced
species
such
that
one
can
distinguish
between
introduced
species
that
may
only
occur
in
cultivation
under
domestication
or
captivity
whereas
others
become
established
outside

such

might

have

to

only
in

the
term
is
used
to
imply
both
a
sense
of
urgency
and
actual
or
potential
harm
for
example
executive
order
defines
invasive
species
as
an
alien
species
whose
introduction
does
or
is
likely
to
cause
economic
or
environmental
harm
or
harm
to
human
the
biological
definition
of
invasive
species
on
the
other
hand
makes
no
reference
to
the
harm
they
may
cause
only
to
the
fact
that
they
spread
beyond
the
area
of
original
some
argue
that
invasive
is
a
loaded
word
and
harm
is
difficult
to
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
organisms
have
and
continue
to
be
introduced
to
areas
where
they
are
not
native
sometimes
with
usually
without
much

it
is
neither

list
as
undesirable
or
outright
ban
all

although
the
of
has
adopted
an
approach
that
comes
close
to
this
regulations
require
a
definitional
distinction
between
that
are
deemed
especially
onerous
and
all
others
introduced
that
are

with

purposely
released
for

in

it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
predict
whether
a
species
will
become
established
upon
release
and
if
not
initially
successful
humans
have
made
repeated
introductions
to
improve
the
probability
that
the
species
will
survive
and
eventually
reproduce
in
the
wild
in
these
cases
it
is
clear
that
the
introduction
is
directly
facilitated
by
human
the
second
case
species
intentionally
transported
into
a
new
region
may
escape
from
captive
or
cultivated
populations
and
subsequently
establish
independent
breeding
populations
escaped
organisms
are
included
in
this
category
because
their
initial
transport
to
a
new

is
human
the
most
common
motivation
for
introducing

a
lover
of

humans
to
introduce
species
as
a
means
of
incurring
some
benefit
while
these
benefits
have
in
some
cases
been
realized
introductions
have
also
resulted
in
unforeseen
costs

when
