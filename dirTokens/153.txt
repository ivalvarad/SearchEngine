john
believed
in
the
fixity
of
the
earliest
works
of
science
a
species
was
simply
an
individual
organism
that
represented
a
group
of
similar
or
nearly
identical
organisms
no
other
relationships
beyond
that
group
were
implied
aristotle

the
words
genus
and
species
to
mean

and
specific
categories
aristotle
and
other
scientists
took
the
species
to
be
distinct
and
unchanging
with
an
essence
like
the
when
early
observers
began
to
develop
systems
of
organization
for
living
things
they
began
to
place
formerly
isolated
species
into
a
context
many
of
these
early
delineation
schemes
would
now
be
considered

an
english
naturalist
was
the
first
to
give
a
biological
definition
of
the
term
the
century
swedish
scientist
classified
organisms
according
to
shared
physical
characteristics
and
not
simply
based
upon
he
is
also
established
the
idea
of
a
taxonomic
hierarchy
of
classification
based
upon
observable
characteristics
and
intended
to
reflect
natural
at
the
time
however
it
was
still
widely
believed
that
there
was
no
organic
connection
between
species
no
matter
how
similar
they
appeared
this
view
was
influenced
by
european
scholarly
and
religious
education
at
the
time
which
held
that
the
categories
of
life
are
dictated
by
god
in
hierarchical
although
there
are
always
differences
although
sometimes
minute
between
individual
organisms
linnaeus
strove
to
identify
individual
organisms
that
were
exemplary
of
the
species
and
considered
other
organisms
to
be
deviant
and
the
century
most
naturalists
understood
that
species
could
change
form
over
time
and
that
the
history
of
the
planet
provided
enough
time
for
major
changes
in
his
offered
one
of
the
first
logical
arguments
against
creationism
the
new
emphasis
was
on
determining
how
a
species
could
change
over
time
lamarck
suggested
that
an
organism
could
pass
on
an
acquired
trait
to
its
offspring
he
attributed
the
giraffe
long
neck
to
generations
of
giraffes
stretching
to
reach
the
leaves
of
higher
treetops
with
the
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
in
the
however
lamarck
view
of
evolution
also
known
as
a
teleological
process
was
eclipsed
recent
interest
in
inheritance
of
acquired
characteristics
centers
around
epigenetic
processes
methylation
that
do
not
affect
dna
sequences
but
instead
alter
expression
in
an
inheritable
manner
thus
as
it
is
sometimes
termed
is
not
a
challenge
to
the
theory
of
evolution
by
natural
darwin
and
provided
what
scientists
now
consider
as
the
most
powerful
and
compelling
of
darwin
argued
that
it
was
populations
that
evolved
not
individuals
his
argument
relied
on
a
radical
shift
in
perspective
from
that
of
linnaeus
rather
than
defining
species
in
ideal
terms
and
searching
for
an
ideal
representative
and
rejecting
deviations
darwin
considered
variation
among
individuals
to
be
natural
he
further
argued
that
variation
far
from
being
problematic
actually
provides
the
explanation
for
the
existence
of
distinct
work
drew
on
insight
that
the
rate
of
growth
of
a
biological
population
will
always
outpace
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
resources
in
the
environment
such
as
the
food
supply
as
a
result
darwin
argued
not
all
the
members
of
a
population
will
be
able
to
survive
and
reproduce
those
that
did
will
on
average
be
the
ones
possessing
variations
however
slight
that
make
them
slightly
better
adapted
to
the
environment
if
these
variable
traits
are
heritable
then
the
offspring
of
the
survivors
will
also
possess
them
thus
over
many
generations
adaptive
variations
will
accumulate
in
the
population
while
traits
will
tend
to
be
a
variation
is
adaptive
or
depends
on
the
environment
different
environments
favor
different
traits
since
the
environment
effectively
selects
which
organisms
live
to
reproduce
it
is
the
environment
the
fight
for
existence
that
selects
the
traits
to
be
passed
on
this
is
the
theory
of
evolution
by
in
this
model
the
length
of
a
giraffe
neck
would
be
explained
by
positing
that
with
longer
necks
would
have
had
a
significant
reproductive
advantage
to
those
with
shorter
necks
over
many
generations
the
entire
population
would
be
a
species
of
when
darwin
published
his
theory
of
natural
selection
the
mechanism
behind
the
inheritance
of
individual
traits
was
unknown
although
darwin
made
some
speculations
on
how
traits
are
inherited
pangenesis
his
theory
relies
only
on
the
fact
that
inheritable
traits
exist
and
are
variable
which
makes
his
accomplishment
even
more
remarkable
although
paper
on
genetics
was
published
in
its
significance
was
not
recognized
it
was
not
until
that
his
work
was
rediscovered
by
de
and
von
who
realised
that
the
inheritable
traits
in
darwin
theory
are
genes
theory
of
the
evolution
of
species
through
natural
selection
has
two
important
implications
for
discussions
of
species
consequences
that
fundamentally
challenge
the
assumptions
behind
linnaeus
taxonomy
first
it
suggests
that
species
are
not
just
similar
they
may
actually
be
related
some
students
of
darwin
argue
that
all
species
are
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
second
it
supposes
that
species
are
not
homogeneous
fixed
permanent
things
members
of
a
species
are
all
different
and
over
time
species
change
this
suggests
that
species
do
not
have
any
clear
boundaries
but
are
rather
momentary
statistical
effects
of
constantly
changing
one
may
still
use
linnaeus
taxonomy
to
identify
individual
plants
and
animals
but
one
can
no
longer
think
of
species
as
independent
and
rise
of
a
new
species
from
a
parental
line
is
called
speciation
there
is
no
clear
line
demarcating
the
ancestral
species
from
the
descendant
the
current
scientific
understanding
of
species
suggests
that
there
is
no
rigorous
and
comprehensive
way
to
distinguish
between
different
species
in
all
cases
biologists
continue
to
seek
concrete
ways
to
operationalize
the
idea
one
of
the
most
popular
biological
definitions
of
species
is
in
terms
of
reproductive
isolation
if
two
creatures
can
not
reproduce
to
produce
fertile
offspring
of
both
sexes
then
they
are
in
different
species
this
definition
captures
a
number
of
intuitive
species
boundaries
but
it
remains
imperfect
it
has
nothing
to
say
about
species
that
reproduce
asexually
for
example
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
apply
to
extinct
species
moreover
boundaries
between
species
are
often
fuzzy
there
are
examples
where
members
of
one
population
can
produce
fertile
offspring
of
both
sexes
with
a
second
population
and
members
of
the
second
population
can
produce
fertile
offspring
of
both
sexes
with
members
of
a
third
population
but
members
of
the
first
and
third
population
can
not
produce
fertile
offspring
or
can
only
produce
fertile
offspring
of
the
homozygous
sex
consequently
some
people
reject
this
definition
of
a
defines
two
organisms
as
conspecific
if
and
only
if
they
have
the
same
number
of
chromosomes
and
for
each
chromosome
both
organisms
have
the
same
number
of
nucleotides
blind
however
most
taxonomists
would
for
example
in
many
amphibians
most
notably
in
new
zealand
leiopelma
frogs
the
genome
consists
of
core
chromosomes
that
are
mostly
invariable
and
accessory
chromosomes
of
which
exist
a
number
of
possible
combinations
even
though
the
chromosome
numbers
are
highly
variable
between
populations
these
can
interbreed
successfully
and
form
a
single
evolutionary
unit
in
plants
polyploidy
is
extremely
commonplace
with
few
restrictions
on
interbreeding
as
individuals
with
an
odd
number
of
chromosome
sets
are
usually
sterile
depending
on
the
actual
number
of
chromosome
sets
present
this
results
in
the
odd
situation
where
some
individuals
of
the
same
evolutionary
unit
can
interbreed
with
certain
others
and
some
can
not
with
all
populations
being
eventually
linked
as
to
form
a
common
gene
classification
of
species
has
been
profoundly
affected
by
technological
advances
that
have
allowed
researchers
to
determine
relatedness
based
on
molecular
markers
starting
with
the
comparatively
crude
precipitation
assays
in
the
century
to
studies
in
the
leading
to
dna
sequencing
techniques
the
results
of
these
techniques
caused
revolutionary
changes
in
the
higher
taxonomic
categories
such
as
phyla
and
classes
resulting
in
the
reordering
of
many
branches
of
the

taxonomic
categories
below

the
results
have
been
mixed
so
far
the
pace
of
evolutionary
change
on
the
molecular
level
is
rather
slow
yielding
clear
differences
only
after
considerable
periods
of
reproductive
separation
hybridization
results
have
led
to
misleading
conclusions

phenomenon

a
famous
turtles

been
determined
to
evolve
with

the
speed
of
other
reptiles
on
the
molecular

evolution

albatrosses

closely
related

within
the
procellariiformes
the
hybridization
technique
is
now
obsolete
and
is
replaced
by
more
reliable
computational
approaches
for
sequence
comparison
molecular
taxonomy
is
not
directly
based
on
the
evolutionary
processes
but
rather
on
the
overall
change
brought
upon
by
these
processes
the
processes

it

been

useful
for

i
look
at
the
term
species
he
wrote
as
one
arbitrarily
given
for
the

of

to
a

of

closely
resembling

it
does
not
essentially
differ
from
the

variety
which
is
given
to
less
distinct
and
more
fluctuating
forms
the
term
variety
again
in
comparison
with
mere
individual
differences
is
also
applied
arbitrarily
and
for
convenience
biologists
define
species
as
of
organisms
that
have
a
high
level
of
genetic
this
may
reflect
an
adaptation
to
the
same
niche
and
the
transfer
of
genetic
material
from
one
individual
to
others
through
a
variety
of
possible
means
the
exact
level
of
similarity
used
in
such
a
definition
is
arbitrary
but
this
is
the
most
common
definition
used
for
organisms
that
reproduce
asexually
such
as
some
plants
and
microorganisms
lack
of
any
clear
species
concept
in
microbiology
has
led
to
some
authors
arguing
that
the
term
species
is
not
useful
when
studying
bacterial
who
instead
they
see
genes
as
moving
freely
between
even
distantly
related
bacteria
with
the
entire
bacterial
domain
being
a
single
gene
pool
nevertheless
a
kind
of
rule
of
thumb
has
been
established
saying
that
species
of
bacteria
or
archaea
with
gene
sequences
more
similar
than
to
each
other
need
to
be
checked
by
if
they
belong
to
the
same
species
or
this
concept
has
been
updated
recently
saying
that
the
border
of
was
too
low
and
can
be
raised
to
the
study
of
sexually
reproducing
organisms
where
genetic
material
is
shared
through
the
process
of
reproduction
the
ability
of
two
organisms
to
interbreed
and
produce
fertile
offspring
of
both
sexes
is
generally
accepted
as
a
simple
indicator
that
the
organisms
share
enough
genes
to
be
considered
members
of
the
same
species
thus
a
species
is
a
group
of
interbreeding
definition
can
be
extended
to
say
that
a
species
is
a
group
of
organisms
that
could
potentially
interbreed
fish
could
still
be
classed
as
the
same
species
even
if
they
live
in
different
lakes
as
long
as
they
could
still
interbreed
were
they
ever
to
come
into
contact
with
each
other
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
examples
of
series
of
three
or
more
distinct
populations
where
individuals
of
the
population
in
the
middle
can
interbreed
with
the
populations
to
either
side
but
individuals
of
the
populations
on
either
side
can
not
interbreed
these
are
known
as
thus
one
could
argue
that
these
populations
constitute
a
single
species
or
two
distinct
species
this
is
not
a
paradox
it
is
evidence
that
species
are
defined
by
gene
frequencies
and
thus
have
fuzzy
any
single
universal
definition
of
species
is
necessarily
arbitrary
instead
biologists
have
proposed
a
range
of
definitions
which
definition
a
biologists
uses
is
a
pragmatic
choice
depending
on
the
particularities
of
that
biologist
practice
these
definitions
often
coincide
and
the
differences
between
them
are
more
a
matter
of
emphasis
than
of
outright
contradiction
nevertheless
no
species
concept
yet
proposed
is
entirely
objective
or
can
be
applied
in
all
cases
without
resorting
to
most
vertebrates
this
is
the
biological

concept

to
a
lesser
extent
or
for
different
purposes
the
phylogenetic
species
concept
psc
many
bsc
subspecies
are
considered
species
under
the
psc
the
difference
between
the
bsc
and
the
psc
can
be
summed
up
insofar
as
that
the
bsc
defines
a
species
as
a
consequence
of
manifest
evolutionary
history
while
the
psc
defines
a
species
as
a
consequence
of
manifest
evolutionary
potential
thus
a
psc
species
is
made
as
soon
as
an
evolutionary
lineage
has
started
to
separate
while
a
bsc
species
starts
to
exist
only
when
the
lineage
separation
is
complete
accordingly
there
can
be
considerable
conflict
between
alternative
classifications

upon
the
psc

bsc

they
differ

treatment

enough
to
differentiate

these

compared

other
concepts

the
popular
biological

psc
also
does

it
is
independent

moreover
psc

a
method
that
also
works
for

applicable
to

range
of
cases
furthermore
when
two
species
have
recently
diverged
and

psc
can
still
detect

the
drawbacks
edit
this
is
a
method
that
works
well
and
often
better
than
other
species
concepts
in
many
situations
psc
does
not
work
in
every
situation
and
can
also
have
drawbacks
for
example
if
a
study
observes
only
one
polymorphic
locus
of
a
group
of
organisms
organisms
that
should
form
distinct
species
could
be
clumped
into
one
species
as
members
of
closely
related
but
distinct
species
may
be
identical
at
this
one
locus
to
avoid
this
problem
one
should
study
multiple
polymorphic
loci
to
achieve
more
accurate
another
drawback
is
that
psc
may
not
work
in
situations
when
genetic
isolation
is
not
recognized
as
a
result
of
only
a
few
of
the
ancestral
polymorphic
loci
being
fixed
at
that
point
in
one
of
the
species
being
observed
the
observed
organisms
may
not
be
separated
into

in
these
cases
species
classification
would
be
most
effective
using
the
morphological

the

number
is
very
difficult

the

range
varies
from
tens
of
thousands
to
most
recent
approaches
and
studies
appear
to
favor
the
larger

smaller
numbers
arise
from
assumptions
based
on
a
plateauing
of
identification
of
new

which
has
technical
explanations
other
than
that
fewer

address
the
fact
that
success
in
culturing
bacteria
has
only
been
achieved
in
half
of
identified
bacterial
phyla

lack
of
success
in
attempts
to
culture

bacterial

the
difficulty

the
classification
of

into

is
also
controversial
as
they
also
reproduce
asexually
likewise
eliminating

these
