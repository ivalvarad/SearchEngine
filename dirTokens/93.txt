was
read
by
the
Israel
as
portending
an
alteration
in
the
closeness
of
-LSB-
83
-RSB-
As
such
,
the
relative
isolation
of
Israel
in
the
preceding
years
as
more
countries
,
particularly
Western
European
ones
that
recognised
Palestine
,
was
viewed
as
having
taken
another
step
backwards
in
such
moves
that
followed
the
pressure
of
the
divestment
and
-LRB-
BDS
-RRB-
movement
and
the
raising
of
the
of
at
the
organs
.
The
of
said
before
the
election
that
Harper
was
``
undoubtedly
the
world
leader
most
supportive
of
Israel
''
and
that
Israel
``
was
about
to
lose
one
of
its
best
friends
on
the
international
stage
...
the
Harper
administration
one
Benjamin
Netanyahu

team
.
''
It
followed
Harper
's
government
's
withdrawal
of
financial
support
for
pro-Palestinian
NGOs
and
UNRWA
.
Yet
,
despite
media
speculation
,
Trudeau
mentioned
in
the
pre-election
debates
that
there
was
no
much
of
a
difference
between
both
parties
over
relations
with
Israel
.
Trudeau
has
also
spoken
of
the
BDS
movement
as
``
an
example
of
the
new
anti-Semitism
in
the
world
,
''
similarly
as
Harper
had
mentioned
.
He
told
Jewish
``
I
'm
all
for
freedom
of
speech
and
expression
in
Canada
,
and
we
need
to
be
sure
we
're
defending
that
.
But
when
Canadian
university
students
are
feeling
unsafe
on
their
way
to
classes
because
of
BDS
or

,
that

following
by
Canada
and
the
Vzglyad
wrote
that
the
election
was
a
failure
for
Harper
.
In
particular
,
it
mentioned
that
during
his
tenure
Canada
was
said
to
have
obtained
the
status
as
one
of
the
most
``
anti-Russian
''
countries
in
the
world
as
on
of
the
first
states
to
impose
sanctions
,
as
well
as
visa
restrictions
.
Director
of
the
Canada
Department
at
the
Russian
Academy
of
Sciences
'
Institute
of
US
and
Canadian
Studies
Vasily
Sokolov
said
that
the
Conservatives
'
defeat
wasa
good
sign
for
Russia
.
``
The
young
leader
of
the
Liberal
Party
is
unlikely
to
bear
any
personal
grudges
against
Russia
.
He
is
the
son
of
Pierre
Trudeau
,
who
did
a
lot
for
Canada
,
particularly
for
the
development
of
Canadian-USSR
relations
.
With
time
this
will
happen
.

will

Bloomberg
suggested
that
the
defeat
was
also
a
blow
to
the
BOE
's
Carney
,
who
harboured
hopes
of
running
as
the
Liberal
's
leader
at
some
point
in
the
future
.
This
was
partly
due
to
his
attempt
to
shorten
his
eight-year
tenure
to
five
years
.
Peter
Loewen
,
of
the
of
was
quoted
as
saying
:
``
The
thing
about
Carney
is
,
he
's
genuinely
publicly
minded
.
If
Justin
Trudeau
had
flaked
out
,
Carney
's
chances
of
being
Liberal
leader
would
have
been
good
,
but
that
door
has
closed
.
''
While
other
suggestions
were
made
he
could
take
a
position
at
the
IMF
instead
,
Carney
has
said
:
``
I
'm
surprised
that
it
would
be
suggested
that
taking
one
of
the
most
challenging
jobs
in
central
banking
in
another
country
would
viewed
as
politically
advantageous
in
my
home
country
.
If
I
had
political
ambitions
,
I
would
pursue
them
in
Canada
,
so

think

is
revealed
preference
