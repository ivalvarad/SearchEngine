he
would
stick

please
do
not

this
message
until
the
is
liberal
defeat
of
harper
conservatives
were
read
as
a
defeat
for
israel
as
well
as
separately
a
boon
for
russia
canadian
of
boe
governor
was
also
mentioned
in
the
a
traditionally
more
neutral
canada
had
been
viewed
as
under
a
change
in
government
was
read
by
the
israel
as
portending
an
alteration
in
the
closeness
of
as
such
the
relative
isolation
of
israel
in
the
preceding
years
as
more
countries
particularly
western
european
ones
that
recognised
palestine
was
viewed
as
having
taken
another
step
backwards
in
such
moves
that
followed
the
pressure
of
the
divestment
and
bds
movement
and
the
raising
of
the
of
at
the
organs
the
of
said
before
the
election
that
harper
was
undoubtedly
the
world
leader
most
supportive
of
israel
and
that
israel
was
about
to
lose
one
of
its
best
friends
on
the
international
stage
the
harper
administration
one
benjamin
netanyahu
dream
team
it
followed
harper
government
withdrawal
of
financial
support
for
ngos
and
unrwa
yet
despite
media
speculation
trudeau
mentioned
in
the
debates
that
there
was
no
much
of
a
difference
between
both
parties
over
relations
with
israel
trudeau
has
also
spoken
of
the
bds
movement
as
an
example
of
the
new
in
the
world
similarly
as
harper
had
mentioned
he
told
jewish
i
all
for
freedom
of
speech
and
expression
in
canada
and
we
need
to
be
sure
we
defending
that
but
when
canadian
university
students
are
feeling
unsafe
on
their
way
to
classes
because
of
bds
or
israel
apartheid
week
that
just
goes
against
canadian
regards
to
relations
with
russia
following
by
canada
and
the
vzglyad
wrote
that
the
election
was
a
failure
for
harper
in
particular
it
mentioned
that
during
his
tenure
canada
was
said
to
have
obtained
the
status
as
one
of
the
most
countries
in
the
world
as
on
of
the
first
states
to
impose
sanctions
as
well
as
visa
restrictions
director
of
the
canada
department
at
the
russian
academy
of
sciences
institute
of
us
and
canadian
studies
vasily
sokolov
said
that
the
conservatives
defeat
wasa
good
sign
for
russia
the
young
leader
of
the
liberal
party
is
unlikely
to
bear
any
personal
grudges
against
russia
he
is
the
son
of
pierre
trudeau
who
did
a
lot
for
canada
particularly
for
the
development
of
relations
with
time
this
will
happen
contacts
will
become
closer
from
the
russian
point
of
view
the
liberal
party
victory
gives
us
certain
bloomberg
suggested
that
the
defeat
was
also
a
blow
to
the
boe
carney
who
harboured
hopes
of
running
as
the
liberal
leader
at
some
point
in
the
future
this
was
partly
due
to
his
attempt
to
shorten
his
tenure
to
five
years
peter
loewen
of
the
of
was
quoted
as
saying
the
thing
about
carney
is
he
genuinely
publicly
minded
if
justin
trudeau
had
flaked
out
carney
chances
of
being
liberal
leader
would
have
been
good
but
that
door
has
closed
while
other
suggestions
were
made
he
could
take
a
position
at
the
imf
instead
carney
has
said
i
surprised
that
it
would
be
suggested
that
taking
one
of
the
most
challenging
jobs
in
central
banking
in
another
country
would
viewed
as
politically
advantageous
in
my
home
country
if
i
had
political
ambitions
i
would
pursue
them
in
canada
so
i

this
