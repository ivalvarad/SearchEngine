seems
like
there
is
one
a

what
is
the
obsession
this

is
overly
reliant
on
these

and
there
is
clearly
not
enough
variation
can
these
be
limited
to
one
a
year
or
something
a
little
more
sensible

you

check

we
have

which
have
been
running
at
the
rate
of
one

two
a

so

talk

one
who
lends
a
hand
at
wp
fpc
i
agree
that
users
are
encouraged
to
participate
in
the
selection
process
outside
of
the
nominator
all
voters
are
expected
to
have
been
on
wikipedia
for
days
and
to
have
made
a
minimum
of
edits
but
i
also
agree
with
the
ip
user
above
that
the
series
of
map
projections
has
become
repetitive
since
we
have
a
large
backlog
of
approved
fps
perhaps
the
maps
could
be
spread
out
a
bit
more
sca
talk
october
utc
exactly
is
one
or
two
a
month
not
spread
out
enough
i
concede
that
the
birds
last
year
could
have
been
spread
out
a
bit
better
five
a
month
was
perhaps
a
bit
much
but
one
or
two
a
month
is
far
from
problematic
even
this
month
we
had
one
projection
on
october
and
one
on
october
that
two
weeks
not
one
week
the
ip
suggestion
that
we
run
one
a
year
is
clearly
untenable
considering
how
many
we
have
and
disrespectful
to
the
images
nominator
and
talk
october
ok
i
give
but
i
gon
na
oppose
any
further
noms
sca
talk
october
utc
have
been
any
since
june
so
nobody
should
have
to
worry
about
adding
to
the
number
of
projections
for
talk
october
edit
everyone
i
new
to
this
site
and
a
computer
student
as
well
want
to
start
off
with
some
basics
regarding
the
domains
guys
any
information
blogs
articles
from
your
end
will
help
me
the
edit
seems
strange
as
i
more
used
to
seeing
articles
like
this
at
afd
with
complaints
that
notability
is
as
the
article
is
mostly
conjecture
and
the
main
source
mao
himself
did
even
get
her
age
right
i
quite
surprised
this
passed
as
an
fa
still
at
least
it
makes
a
change
from
the
interminable
banksia
two
so
far
this
month
along
with
the
usual
hurricanes
mushrooms
this
gives
the
impression
that
we
scraping
the
barrel
to
find
topics
for
this
slot
is
there
a
place
where
editors
discuss
this
issue
and
try
to
do
something
about
it
i
often
come
across
interesting
topics
but
usually
stop
at
putting
them
forward
for
dyk
perhaps
there
should
be
a
nursery
where
more
varied
topics
are
encouraged
to
advance
to
the
next
level
talk
october
fact
that
you
usually
stop
at
putting
articles
forward
for
dyk
is
telling
here
we
ca
run
something
in
tfa
if
it
not
listed
at
wp
fa
having
gone
through
our
featured
article
process
and
the
editors
who
put
forth
articles
there
often
find
themselves
dealing
with
an
area
of
expertise
which
is
why
certain
topics
are
represented
more
heavily
than
others
since
this
is
a
volunteer
project
there
no
way
to
force
people
to
stop
working
on
the
topics
they
care
about
and
redirect
them
elsewhere
nor
would
we
be
wise
to
try
so
the
only
alternative
to
wanting
to
see
different
subjects
covered
is
to
roll
up
the
sleeves
and
pitch
in
g
rapple
x
october
only
way
to
fix
the
problem
is
to
add
new
types
of
articles
to
the
pool
of
articles
available
to
put
on
the
main
page
at
wp
fa
in
other
words
make
more
featured
articles
from
other
topics
there
is
no
other
way
to
fix
this
so
unless
you
are
working
to
make
articles
better
and
make
them
featurable
on
the
main
page
by
the
wp
fa
standards
you
are
doing
any
good
in
fixing
the
problem
jayron
october
conflict
with
jayron
what
you
are
looking
for
is
a
wp
fanmp
the
pool
of
eligible
articles
featured
articles
yet
to
run
on
the
main
page
and
b
wp
tfar
where
nominations
for
today
featured
article
are
discussed
where
there
are
no
nominations
the
tfa
coordinators
select
something
from
the
pool
doing
their
best
to
achieve
balance
from
the
options
available
you
will
notice
that
the
pool
of
eligible
articles
contains
many
more
options
in
some
areas
warfare
compared
to
others
mathematics
computing
engineering
health
education
philosophy
the
best
way
to
see
fewer
articles
that
in
your
view
scrap
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
is
to
help
review
write
and
promote
alternatives
bear
in
mind
of
course
that
what
you
find
boring
others
will
find
interesting
and
vice
versa
the
tfa
coordinators
i
used
to
be
one
have
to
balance
the
wheat
and
the
chaff
bearing
in
mind
that
a
different
people
will
disagree
on
which
is
which
and
b
our
purpose
is
to
show
the
range
and
detail
of
the
best
of
our
encyclopaedic
coverage
not
to
provide
clickbait
bencherlite
talk
october
seems
to
be
a
standard
niggle
from
this
user
in
fact
the
dyk
he
mentions
is
actually
pretty
low
quality
and
really
should
be
on
the
main
page
at
all
but
there
your
mileage
may
vary
if
you
do
get
involved
in
the
process
do
bitch
about
the
fact
you
do
like
the
outcome
and
most
of
the
things
you
ever
suggested
as
interesting
to
you
are
as
dull
as
dishwater
to
me
you
see
how
that
works
everyone
has
a
subjective
opinion
this
is
more
about
article
quality
not
whether
you
personally
like
it
rambling
talk
october
love
seeing
this
sort
of
complaint
about
tfa
as
it
makes
it
feel
like
all
over
again
when
we
had
them
almost
every
day
or
so
it
felt
we
do
have
on
this
subject
but
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
is
help
develop
a
featured
article
on
a
topic
you
find
interesting

a
few

i
do
think
you
really
have
room
to
criticize
if
you
not
actively
trying
to
improve
the
situation
otherwise
it
just
comes
off
as
insulting
to
those
who
put
considerable
time
and
effort
into
making
featured
articles
that
can
be
showcased
in
the
first
place
accordingly
i
share
the
same
sentiments
as
trm
expresses
above
i
can
directly
address
one
of
the
accusations
about
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
in
regards
to
hurricane
wp
wptc
prides
itself
on
producing
as
much
quality
content
as
possible
we
help
each
other
out

work
to

our
subject
to
the
best
of
our
abilities
there
are
featured
articles
