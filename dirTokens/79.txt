way
of
distinguishing

based
on

to
the
late
beginning

jettisoned
much
of
its

and
settled
onto

year
subsequently
strikes
among

elements
of

the
nature

grew
broader

initially
they

forgiveness
from
his
people
such
a
gesture
so
unusual
for
the
african
autocrats
of

have
fatally
weakened
political
standing

he
performed
the
gesture
in
such
a
way
that
far
from
ending
his
political
career
it
instead
served
to
symbolically
redeem
him
and
facilitate
his
political
rehabilitation
while
also
securing
