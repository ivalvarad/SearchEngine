has
been
suggested
that
Kérékou
's
move
to
Marxism-Leninism
was
motivated
mainly
by
pragmatic
considerations
,
and
that
Kérékou
himself
was
not
actually
a
leftist
radical
;
the
new
ideology
offered
a
means
of
legitimization
,
a
way
of
distinguishing
the
new
regime
from
those
that
had
preceded
it
,
and
was
based
on
broader
unifying
principles
than
the
politics
of
ethnicity
.
Kérékou
's
regime
initially
included
officers
from
both
the
north
and
south
of
the
country
,
but
as
the
years
passed
the
northerners

himself

clearly
dominant
,
undermining

idea

rigid
and
vigorous
in
pursuing
its
newly
adopted
ideological
goals
from
the
mid-1970s
to
the
late
1970s
.
Beginning
in
the
late
1970s
,
the
regime
jettisoned
much
of
its
radicalism
and
settled
onto
a
more
moderately
socialist
course
as
Kérékou

was
hoped
that
the
nationalizations
of

would
help

,
but
it
remained
in
a
very
poor
condition
,
with
the
state
sector
being
plagued
by
inefficiency
and
corruption
.
Kérékou
began
reversing
course
in
the
early

down
numerous
state-run
companies

The

continued
to
worsen

,
provoking
widespread
unrest
in

.
A
student
strike
began
in
January
of
that
year
;
subsequently
strikes
among
various
elements
of
society
increased
in
frequency
and
the
nature
of
their
demands
grew
broader

,
Benin
moved
onto
this
path
early
,
with
Kérékou
being
forced
to
make
concessions
to

discontent
.
Benin
's
early
and

be

In

was
re-elected
as

by

in
August
-LSB-

-RSB-
but
in
December
1989
Marxism-Leninism
was
dropped
as
the
state
-LSB-
11
-RSB-
and
a
national
conference
was
held
in
February
1990
.
The
conference
turned
out
to
be
hostile
to
Kérékou
and
declared
its
own
sovereignty
;
despite
the
objections
of
some
of
his
officers
to
this
turn
of
events
,
Kérékou
did
not
act
against
the
-LSB-

-RSB-
although
he
labelled
the
conference
's
declaration
of
sovereignty
a
``
civilian
coup
''
.
During
the
transition
that
followed
,
Kérékou
remained

the

National
Conference
,
which
was
nationally
televised
,
Kérékou
spoke
to
the
of
de
confessing
guilt
and
begging
forgiveness
for
the
flaws
of
his
regime
.
An
observer
described
it
as
a
``
remarkable
piece
of
political
theater
''
,
full
of
cultural
symbolism
and
significance
;
in
effect
,
Kérékou
was
seeking
forgiveness
from
his
people
.
Such
a
gesture
,
so
unusual
for
the
African
autocrats
of
the
time
,
could
have
fatally
weakened
Kérékou
's
political
standing
,
but
he
performed
the
gesture
in
such
a
way
that
,
far
from
ending
his
political
career
,
it
instead
served
to
symbolically
redeem
him
and
facilitate
his
political
rehabilitation
,
while
also
``
securing
him
immunity
from
prosecution
''
.
Kérékou
shrewdly
utilized
the
timing
and
