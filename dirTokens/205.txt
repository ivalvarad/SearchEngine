a
porthole
on
the
porthole
is
a
generally
circular
window
used
on
the
hull
of
ships
to
admit
light
and
air
though
the
term
is
of
obvious
maritime
origin
it
is
also
used
to
describe
round
windows
on
aircraft
automobiles
the
a
notable
example
and
even
spacecraft
a
ship
the
function
of
a
porthole
when
open
is
to
permit
light
and
fresh
air
to
enter
the
dark
and
often
damp
deck
quarters
of
the
vessel
it
also
affords
occupants
a
limited
but
often
much
needed
view
to
the

closed

sometimes
porthole

the
word
porthole
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
location
on
the
of
a
ship
but
originated
during
the
reign
of
vi
of
the
king
insisted
on
mounting
guns
too
large
for
his
ships
and
therefore
the
conventional
methods
of
securing
the
weapons
on
the
forecastle
and
aftcastle
could
not
be
used
a
french
shipbuilder
named
james
baker
was
commissioned
to
solve
the
problem
which
he
did
by
piercing
the
ship
sides
so
the
cannon
could
be
mounted
inside
the
fore
and
after
castles
for
heavy
weather
and
when
the
cannons
were
not
in
use
the
openings
were
fitted
with
covers
that
were
called
porte
in
french
meaning
door
porte
was
anglicized
to
port
and
later
corrupted
to
porthole
eventually
it
came
to
mean
any
opening
in
a
ship
side
whether
for
cannon
or

a
brass
porthole
with
hinged
window
and
storm
rows
of
portholes
can
be
seen
on
the
hull
of
a
british
from
the
porthole
consists
of
at
least
two
structural
components
and
is
in
its
simplest
form
similar
to
any
other
type
of
window
in
design
and
purpose
the
porthole
is
primarily
a
circular
glass
disk
encased
in
a
metal
frame
that
is
bolted
securely
into
the
side
of
a
ship
hull
sometimes
the
glass
disk
of
a
porthole
is
encased
in
a
separate
frame
which
is
hinged
onto
the
base
frame
so
that
it
can
be
opened
and
closed
in
addition
many
portholes
also
have
metal
storm
covers
that
can
be
securely
fastened
against
the
window
when
necessary
the
main
purpose
of
the
storm
cover
is
as
its
name
implies
to
protect
the
window
from
heavy
seas
it
is
also
used
to
block
light
from
entering
lower
berths
when
darkness
is
preferred
the
storm
cover
is
referred
to
as
a
deadlight
in
maritime
parlance
storm
covers
are
also
used
on
navy
and
merchant
marine
ships
to
prevent
interior
light
from
escaping
the
ship
lower
berths
and
to
provide
protection
from
hostile
fire
hinged
porthole
windows
and
storm
covers
are
accessible
from
inside
the
ship
hull
and
are
typically
fastened
to
their
closed
positions
by
hand
tightening
several
pivoting
threaded
devices
commonly
referred
to
as
dogs
older
portholes
can
be
identified
by
the
protruding
collar
of
their
base
plate
which
may
be
up
to
several
inches
deep
thus
accommodating
the
thickness
of
a
wooden
range
in
diameter
from
several
inches
to
more
than
two
feet
and
weigh
from
several
pounds
to
over
one
hundred
pounds
much
of
the
porthole
weight
comes
from
its
glass
which
on
ships
can
be
as
much
as
two
inches
thick
metal
components
of
a
porthole
are
also
typically
very
heavy
they
are
usually
and
made
of
bronze
brass
steel
iron
or
aluminium
bronze
and
brass
are
most
commonly
used
favoured
for
their
resistance
to
saltwater
corrosion
the
design
of
the
porthole
is
such
that
it
achieves
its
humble
purposes
without
sacrificing
the
integrity
of
the
ship
hull
the
porthole
thick
glass
and
rugged
construction
tightly
spaced
fasteners
indeed
even
its
round
shape
all
contribute
to
its
purpose
of
maintaining
hull
strength
and
withstanding

pressure
of

a

number
of
portholes

ships

higher
superstructures
with
more
upper

cabins
which
can
have
large
windows
and
balconies
most
warships
no
longer
have
portholes
on
their
main
hulls
as
they
could
weaken
them
and
modern
vessels
have
