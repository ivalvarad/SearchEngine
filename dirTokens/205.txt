a
generally
circular
window

of

the
function
of
a
porthole
,
when
open
,
is
to
permit
light
and
fresh
air
to
enter
the
dark
and
often
damp
deck

of
the
vessel
.
It
also
affords
below-deck
occupants
a
limited

often
much
needed

,
the
word
``
porthole
''
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
location
on
the
of
a
ship
,
but
originated
during
the
reign
of
VI
of
-LRB-
1485
-RRB-
.
The
king
insisted
on
mounting
guns
too
large
for
his
ships
and
therefore
the
conventional
methods
of
securing
the
weapons
on
the
forecastle
and
aftcastle
could
not
be
used
.
A
French
shipbuilder
named
James
Baker
was
commissioned
to
solve
the
problem
,
which
he
did
by
piercing
the
ship
's
sides
so
the
cannon
could
be
mounted
inside
the
fore
and
after
castles
.
For
heavy
weather
and
when
the
cannons
were
not
in
use
,
the
openings
were
fitted
with
covers
,
that
were
called
porte
in
French
,
meaning
door
Porte
was
Anglicized
to
``
port
''
and
later
corrupted
to
porthole
.
Eventually
,
it
came
to
mean
any
opening
in
a
ship
's
side
whether
for
cannon

A
brass
porthole
with
hinged
window
and
storm
Rows
of
portholes
can
be
seen
on
the
hull
of
a
British
from
the
porthole
consists
of
at
least
two
structural
components
and
is
,
in
its
simplest
form
,
similar
to
any
other
type
of
window
in
design
and
purpose
.
The
porthole
is
primarily
a
circular
glass
disk
encased
in
a
metal
frame
that
is
bolted
securely
into
the
side
of
a
ship
's
hull
.
Sometimes
the
glass
disk
of
a
porthole
is
encased
in
a
separate
frame
which
is
hinged
onto
the
base
frame
so
that
it
can
be
opened
and
closed
.
In
addition
,
many
portholes
also
have
metal
storm
covers
that
can
be
securely
fastened
against
the
window
when
necessary
.
The
main
purpose
of
the
storm
cover
is
,
as
its
name
implies
,
to
protect
the
window
from
heavy
seas
.
It
is
also
used
to
block
light
from
entering
lower
berths
when
darkness
is
preferred
.
The
storm
cover
is
referred
to
as
a
deadlight
in
maritime
parlance
.
Storm
covers
are
also
used
on
Navy
and
merchant
marine
ships
to
prevent
interior
light
from
escaping
the
ship
's
lower
berths
,
and
to
provide
protection
from
hostile
fire
.
Hinged
porthole
windows
and
storm
covers
are
accessible
from
inside
the
ship
's
hull
,
and
are
typically
fastened
to
their
closed
positions
by
hand
tightening
several
pivoting
,
threaded
devices
,
commonly
referred
to
as
``
dogs
.
''
Older
portholes
can
be
identified
by
the
protruding
collar
of
their
base
plate
which
may
be
up
to
several
inches
deep
,
thus
accommodating
the
thickness
of
a
wooden
range
in
diameter
from
several
inches
to
more
than
two
feet
,
and
weigh
from
several
pounds
to
over
one
hundred
pounds
.
Much
of
the
porthole
's
weight
comes
from
its
glass
,
which
,
on
ships
,
can
be
as
much
as
two
inches
thick
.
Metal
components
of
a
porthole
are
also
typically
very
heavy
;
they
are
usually
sand-cast
and
made
of
bronze
brass
steel
iron
or
aluminium
Bronze
and
brass
are
most
commonly
used
,
favoured
for
their
resistance
to
saltwater
corrosion
The
design
of
the
porthole
is
such
that
it
achieves
its
humble
purposes
without
sacrificing
the
integrity
of
the
ship
's
hull
.
The
porthole
's
thick
glass
and
rugged
construction
,
tightly
spaced
fasteners
,
indeed
even
its
round
shape
,
all
contribute
to
its
purpose
of
maintaining
hull
strength
and
withstanding

Most
