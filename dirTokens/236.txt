overview

is
based
on
the
concept
of
elementary
building
blocks
that
can
be
combined
to
support
a
wide
variety
of
network
transport
semantics
portals
provides
data
movement
operations
but
unlike
other
programming
interfaces
the
target
of
a
remote
operation
is
not
a
instead
the
ultimate
destination
in
memory
of
an
incoming
message
is
determined
at
the
receiver
by
comparing
contents
of
the
message
header
with
the
contents
of
structures
at
the
destination
this
flexibility
allows
for
efficient
implementations
of
both
and
communications
in
particular
portals
is
aimed
at
providing
the
fundamental
operations
necessary
to
support
a
and
scalable
implementation
of
the

mpi
it
was
also
used
as
the
initial

began
in
the
early
as
an
extension
to
the
nx

system
used
in
the
sunmos
and
puma
operating
system
it
was
first
implemented
for
the
at
sandia
and
later
ported
to
the
machine
named
there
were
four
building
blocks
in
the
first
version
of
portals
the
single
block
the
dynamic
block
the
independent
block
and
the
combined
block
all
incoming
messages
would
first
pass
through
a
that
allowed
individual
portals
to
respond
to
specific
groups

portals
concept
continued
to
evolve
over
successive
generations
of
lightweight
kernels
and
massively
parallel
systems
in
an
operational
programming
interface
was
given
to
portals
so
that
it
could
be
implemented
for
intelligent
or
programmable
network
interfaces
outside
of
a
lightweight
kernel
this
standard
was
designed
for
systems
where
the
work
required
to
prepare
transmit
and
deliver
messages
is
longer
than
the
to
the
portals
data
structures
for
example
in
modern
systems
this
work
is
dominated
by
the
through
the
io
bus
to
the
network
interface
the
standard
has
been
revised
since
the
initial
release
to
make
it
more
suited
for
modern
high
performance
massively
parallel
the
mpi
library
was
ported
from
the
retronymed
portals
to
the
new
portals
portals
specification
has
been
implemented
several
times
first
on
then
on
cplant
over
myrinet
linux
and
the
edit
light
of
emerging
global
address
pgas
languages
several
new
features
have
been
added
to
the
portals
api
as
part
of

portals
also
made
several
changes
to
improve
the
interaction
between
the

and
