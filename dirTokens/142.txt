are

theories
about

origin
of

word
chile
according
to
spanish
chronicler
de
the
incas
called
the
valley
of
the
aconcagua
chili
by
corruption
of
the
name
of
a
picunche
cacique
called
tili
who
ruled
the
area
at
the
time
of
the
incan
conquest
in
the
another
theory
points
to
the
similarity
of
the
valley
of
the
aconcagua
with
that
of
the
in
peru
where
there
was
a
town
and
valley
named
chili
theories
say
chile
may
derive
its
name
from
a
word
meaning
either
ends
of
the
earth
or
sea
from
the
mapuche
word
chilli
which
may
mean
where
the
land
or
from
the
quechua
chiri
or
tchili
meaning
either
or
the
deepest
point
of
the
another
origin
attributed
to
chilli
is
the
onomatopoeic
mapuche
imitation
of
the
warble
of
a
bird
locally
known
as
trile
spanish
conquistadors
heard
about
this
name
from
