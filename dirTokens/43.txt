mountain
a
combined
mission
targeted
at
taliban
fighters
in
the
south
of
the
country
in
july
this
offensive
mission
essentially
stalled
in
helmand
as
nato
primarily
british
and
afghan
troops
were
forced
to
take
increasingly
defensive
positions
under
heavy
insurgent
pressure
in
response
british
troop
levels
in
the
province
were
increased
and
new
encampments
were
established
in
sangin
and
gereshk
fighting
has
been
particularly
heavy
in
the
districts
of
sangin
naway
nawzad

garmsir
there
were
reports
that
the
taliban
saw
helmand
province
as
a
key
testing
area
for
their
ability
to
take

hold
afghan
territory

stationed
earlier

the
terms
of
the
agreement
both
sets
of
forces
were
to
withdraw
from
the
conflict
zone
this
agreement
from
the
british
forces
implied
that
the
strategy
of
holding
key
bases
in
the
district
as
requested
by
was
essentially
untenable
with
the
current
levels
of
british
troop
deployment
the
agreement
was
also
a
setback
for
