incremental

to

,
an
approach
that
led
to
two
basic
types
of
test
chamber
.
The
first
type
,
which
Valve
calls
``

,
provides
a
relatively

for

with

the
second
type
combines
elements
in
new
ways
to
force
the
player
to
providing
challenging
and
rewarding
puzzles
.
Chambers
were
first
developed
through

The

simple

observed
alternative
solutions

by
playtesters
.
Based
on
play-testing
results
,
the
design
team
retained
these
alternative
solutions
or
blocked
them
if
they
were
considered
too
-LSB-

These
versions
were
sent
back
for
further
play-testing
to
verify
that
the

prevent

designed

Some
of
