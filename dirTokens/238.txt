the
success
of

valve
decided
to
make
a
standalone
product
partly
because
of
pressure
from
other
developers
within
valve
who
wanted
to
work
on
a
portal
work
began
almost
immediately
after
the
release
of
portal
valve
committed
more
resources
to
development
than
they
had
for

first

had
a
team
of
seven
or
eight
people
but
had
a
team
of
or
the
initial
team
of
four
was
expanded
as
subgroups
formed
to
devise
game
mechanics
and
to
plot
the
story
participants
in
internal
review
processes
were
inspired
by
what
they
saw
to
join
the
project
according
to
erik
wolpaw
some
developers
worked
on
the
games
to
help
them
meet
milestones

returned

people

goal
for

to
find
a
way

he
considered
a
pretty
terrifying
in

one

before

later
stated
that
the
use

word
probably
suggests
that
this

newell
said
that
valve
is
not
giving
up
on
at
all
but
intends
to
include
more
social
features
on
top
of
the
single

experience
akin
to
the
cooperative
mode
in
design
edit
in
its
development
the
development
team
planned
to
exclude
portals
from

five
months
valve
focused
on
a
gameplay
mechanic
called
the
specifics
of
which
as
of
january
update
are
unknown
outside

the
developers
considered
using
it
for
a
new
though
the
new
mechanics
prompted
some
positive
feedback
every
playtester
expressed
disappointment
at
the
omission
of
following
a
report
in
kotaku
of
some
leaked
aspects
of
the
game
plot
then
under
consideration
newell
directed
the
team
to
reconsider
its
plans
for
including
the
lack
of
several
of
the
early
test
chambers
in

reused
the
original
chambers
from

top
deterioration
and
aging
were
added
to
provide
familiarity
to
the
player
while
suggesting
the
length
of
time
between
the
two
stated
that
valve
aim
was
not
to
make
more
difficult
than
its
predecessor
but
instead
to
produce
a
game
where
you
think
your
way
through
particular
parts
of
the
level
and
feel
really
smart
when
you
solve
allows
the
player
to
take
incremental
steps
to
understand
the
game
mechanics
an
approach
that
led
to
two
basic
types
of
test
chamber
the
first
type
which
valve
calls
checklisting
provides
a
relatively
safe
environment
for
player
to
experiment
with
a
new
gameplay
concept
the
second
type
combines
elements
in
new
ways
to
force
the
player
to
providing
challenging
and
rewarding
puzzles
chambers
were
first
developed
through
whiteboard
via
isometric
drawings
the
developers
performed
a
on
the
chamber
before
crafting
simple
levels
with
a
software
tool
called
the
level
extensive
playtesting
ensured
the
solutions
to
each
chamber
were
neither
too
obvious
nor
too
difficult
and
observed
alternative
solutions
discovered
by
playtesters
based
on
results
the
design
team
retained
these
alternative
solutions
or
blocked
them
if
they
were
considered
too
these
versions
were
sent
back
for
further
to
verify
that
the
new
elements
did
not
prevent
players
from
finding
solutions
further
iterations
between
artists
and
playtesters
occurred
until
such
issues
were
some
elements
from
portal
were
modified
to
suit
whereas
players
of
portal
would
be
familiar
with
the
game
mechanics
novice
players
required
some
training
as
would
players
of
portal
for
some
game
elements
for
example
the
energy
spheres
used
in
the
first
game
were
replaced
with
lasers
which
provided
immediate
feedback
and
reduced
the
training
designers
built
several
of
early
chambers
by
applying
decay
collapse
and
overgrowth
to
portal
chambers
to
give
portal
players
a
sense
of
nostalgia
and
a
sense
of
time
passed
in
the
game
world
the
design
team
replaced
low
resolution
textures
from
the
first
game
with
dirty
textures
that
the
new
game
engine
could
the
middle
section
of
the
campaign
takes
place
in
large
spaces
in
which
most
surfaces
are
unable
to
accept
portals
which
forces
players
to
find
creative
ways
to
cross
much
of
the
architecture
in
these
sections
was
inspired
by
photographs
of
industrial
complexes
including
cern
nasa
and
the
abandoned
space
according
to
writer
in
the
game
final
section
in
which
wheatley
controls
the
aperture
facility
the
level
designers
just
had
a
blast
creating
deranged
chambers
reflecting
wheatley
the
designers
recognized
that
solving
puzzles
would
mentally
tire
players
so
they
inserted
occasional
experiences
to
provide
a
respite
and
to

cooperative

from
players
requests
and
from
anecdotes
of
players
working

on

or

to
solve

puzzles
wolpaw
likened
this
to
players
working
together
on
the
same
computer
to
solve
adventure
the
cooperative
campaign
was
also
inspired
by
valve
cooperative
games
in
which
players
enjoyed
discussing
their
personal
experiences
with
the
game
when
they
had
finished
playing
while
the
single
player
campaign
in
is
designed
to
avoid
frustrating
the
player
the
cooperative
levels
focus
on
coordination
and
communication
and
valve
recognizes
they
are
much
more
difficult
than
the
valve
did
not
include
timed
puzzles
in
the
campaigns
in
portal
and
but
found
that
their
inclusion
in
the
cooperative
mode
is
effective
and
gives
players
a
positive
feeling
after
they
successfully
plan
and
execute
difficult
each
puzzle
chamber
in
the
cooperative
mode
requires
four
portals
to
solve
to
prevent
puzzles
being
solved
by
the
actions
of
only
one
player
as
soon
as
a
playtester
discovered
a
way
to
complete
a
puzzle
with
one
set
of
portals
the
level
was
sent
back
to
the
designers
for
further
except
in
a
few
cases
valve
designed
the
chambers
so
that
both
players
would
remain
in
sight
of
each
other
to
promote
communication
and
cooperation
some
of
the
puzzle
chambers
were
designed
asymmetrically
one
player
would
manipulate
portals
and
controls
to
allow
the
other
player
to
cross
the
room
emphasizing
that
the
two
characters
while
working
together
are
separate
the
designers
soon
realized
that
the
ability
to
tag
surfaces
with
instructional
icons
for
one
partner
was
a
necessary
element
since
they
found
this
to
be
more
effective
for
cooperation
than
simple
verbal
considered
adding
a
competitive
mode
to
according
to
wolpaw
the
mode
was
similar
to
the
video
game
speedball
one
team
would
try
to
transport
a
ball
from
one
side
of
the
playing
field
to
the
other
using
portals
while
the
other
team
would
attempt
to
stop
them
with
their
own
use
of
portals
matches
would
commence
with
this
objective
in
mind
but
quickly
descended
into
chaos
valve
realized
that
people
enjoyed
solving
puzzles
with
portals
more
and
therefore
they
focused
on
the
cooperative
writing

lines
of
the
writers
felt
they
needed
to
create
a
larger
story
for
a
title
and
wanted
the
game
to
feel
relatively
intimate
and
avoided
adding
too
many
new
they
considered
expanding
the
sterility
and
dryness
of
portal
and
adding
more
comedy
to
the
script
wolpaw
said
that
while
some
developers
have
been
moving
towards
no
one
had
made
a
comedic
video
the
game
story
development
was
tightly
coordinated
with
the
gameplay
development
and
developers
of
initially
envisioned
it
as
a
prequel
to
portal
set
in
the
long
before
glados
took
over
the
aperture
science
facility
with
events
set
in
motion
when
aperture
ceo
cave
johnson
becomes
trapped
within
a
johnson
would
have
led
an
army
of
robots
which
would
battle
against
the
player
to
rise
to
power
within
in
june
based
on
information
from
a
casting
call
website
and
leaked
script
samples
kotaku
reported
that
valve
was
seeking
voice
actors
to
play
johnson
named
him
as
an
ai
and
identified
the
game
as
a
valve
attributed
this
leak
to
an
overeager
following
negative
playtester
feedback
about
the
omission
of
chell
and
glados
was
as
a
sequel
the
team
returned
to
the
idea
of
exploring
parts
of
the
facility
from
aperture
early
days
and
reincorporated
johnson
through
a
series
of
writers
originally
conceived
several
premature
joke
game
endings
if
the
player
performed
certain
actions
but
these
required
too
much
development
effort
for
little
payback
and
were
scrapped
one
of
these
joke
endings
was
triggered
by
shooting
a
portal
onto
the
moon
surface
after
which
the
player
character
would
die
from
asphyxiation
over
a
closing
song
but
the
idea
of
creating
a
portal
on
the
moon
was
incorporated
into
the
game
final
the
writers
planned
that
chell
would
say
a
single
word
during
the
ending
but
this
was
not
considered
funny
in
an
early
version
of
the
script
chell
finds
a
lost
tribe
of
turrets
looking
for
their
leader
a
huge
animal
king
turret
which
can
be
seen
in
videos
of
the
retail
product
as
a
reward
the
animal
king
would
have
married
chell
to
a
turret
which
would
have
followed
chell
around
the
game
without
visible
the
cooperative
campaign
was
planned
to
feature
a
more
detailed
storyline
in
which
glados
would
send
two
robots
to
discover
human
artifacts
such
as
a
comic
based
on
a
pastiche
of
garfield
the
writers
hoped
to
use
this
idea
to
make
the
robots
for
testing
purposes
but
recognized
that
unlike
the
captive
audience
of
the
campaign
the
two
players
in
cooperative
mode
may
simply
talk
over
the
story
and
thus
the
story
was
condensed
into
very
basic
said
that
while
many
story
elements
of
portal
are
revisited
in
he
avoided
some
of
the
memes
as
the
frequently
repeated
the
cake
is
a
lie
he
said
if
you
thought
you
were
sick
of
the
memes
i
was
sick
of
it
way
ahead
of
wolpaw
could
resist
putting
in
just
one
cake
the
writers
did
not
try
to
predict
or
write
new
memes
and
wolpaw
said
you
ca
really
plan
for
dialogue
to
become
a
meme
because
if
you
do
it
probably
seems
weird
and
produced
its
own
memes
including
a
personality
valve
later
created
a
space
core
modification
for
the

and
the

core
also
appeared
as

grants

to
humanity
in
the
form

is
then
punished
by
being

realized
that
their
plans
to
have
chell
and
glados
play
off
each
other
would
only
work
if
both
players
spoke
to
remedy
this
they
created
the
caroline
subplot
to
give
glados
an
external
situation
to
deal
with
and
to
drive
the
story

comparisons
have
been
made
between

wolpaw
says
the
