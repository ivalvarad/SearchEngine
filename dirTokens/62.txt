the

during

the
most
important
of
all
presidential
powers
is
the
command
of
the
states

its
while
the
power
to
declare
war
is
constitutionally
vested
in
congress
the

ultimate
responsibility

the

it

congress
provides
a
check
to

military
power

its
control
over
military
spending
and
regulation
while
historically
presidents
initiated
the
process
for
going
to
critics
have
charged
that
there
have
been
several
conflicts
in

the
president
decides
whether
to
recognize
new
nations
and
new
governments

negotiates
treaties
with
other
nations

become
binding
on
the
united
states
when
approved
by
vote
of
the
not
constitutionally
provided
presidents
also
sometimes
employ
executive
agreements
in
foreign
relations
these
agreements
frequently
regard
administrative
policy
choices
germane
to
executive
power
for
example
the
extent
to
which
either
country
presents
an
armed
presence
in
a
given
area
how
each
country
will
enforce
copyright
treaties
or
how
each
country
will
process
foreign
mail
however
the
century
witnessed
a
vast
expansion
of
the
use
of
executive
agreements
and
critics
have
challenged
the
extent
of
that
use
as
supplanting
the
treaty
process
and
removing
constitutionally
prescribed
checks
and
balances
over
the
executive
in
foreign
relations
supporters
counter
that
the
agreements
offer
a
pragmatic
solution
when
the
need
for
swift
secret
concerted
action
it
to
say
that
the
president
is
made
the
sole
repository
of
the
executive

a
contentious
political

just
before

term
not
without
two
doctrines
concerning
executive
power
have
developed
that
enable
the
president
to
exercise
executive
power
with
a
degree
of
autonomy
the
first
is
which
allows
the
president
to
withhold
from
disclosure
any
communications
made
directly
to
the
president
in
the
performance
of
executive
duties
first
claimed
privilege
when
congress
requested
to
see
notes
from
an
unpopular
treaty
negotiation
with
while
not
enshrined
in
the
constitution
or
any
other
law
washington
action
created
the
precedent
for
the
privilege
when
tried
to
use
executive
privilege
as
a
reason
for
not
turning
over
subpoenaed
evidence
to
congress
during
the
the
supreme
court
ruled
in
states
that
executive
privilege
did
not
apply
in
cases
where
a
president
was
attempting
to
avoid
criminal
prosecution
when
president
attempted
to
use
executive
privilege
regarding
the
the
supreme
court
ruled
in
that
the
privilege
also
could
not
be
used
in
civil
suits
these
cases
established
the
that
executive
privilege
is
valid
although
the
exact
extent
of
the
privilege
has
yet
to
be
clearly
defined
additionally
federal
courts
have
allowed
this
privilege
to
radiate
outward
and
protect
other
executive
branch
employees
but
have
weakened
that
protection
for
those
executive
branch
communications
that
do
not
involve
the
president
delivering
the
state
of
the
union
with
and
of
the
behind
secrets
allows
the
president
and
the
executive
branch
to
withhold
information
or
documents
from
discovery
in
legal
proceedings
if
such
release
would
harm
national
security
precedent
for
the
privilege
arose
early
in
the
century
when
refused
to
release
military
documents
in
the
treason
trial
of
and
again
in
united
when
the
supreme
court
dismissed
a
case
brought
by
a
former
union
however
the
privilege
was
not
formally
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
until
states
where
it
was
held
to
be
a
evidentiary
before
the
use
of
the
privilege
had
been
rare
but
increasing
in
since
the
government
has
asserted
the
privilege
in
more
cases
and
at
earlier
stages
of
the
litigation
thus
in
some
instances
causing
dismissal
of
the
suits
before
reaching
the
merits
of
the
claims
as
in
the
ruling
in
jeppesen
dataplan
critics
of
the
privilege
claim
its
use
has
become
a
tool
for
the
government
to
cover
up
illegal
or
embarrassing
government
constitution
prevents
the
president
and
all
other
executive
officers
from
simultaneously
being
a
member
of
congress
therefore
the
president
can
not
directly
introduce
for
consideration
in
congress
however
the
president
can
take
an
indirect
role
in
shaping
legislation
especially
if
the
president
political
party
has
a
majority
in
one
or
both
houses
of
congress
for
example
the
president
or
other
officials
of
the
executive
branch
may
draft
legislation
and
then
ask
senators
or
representatives
to
introduce
these
drafts
into
congress
the
president
can
further
influence
the
legislative
branch
through
constitutionally
mandated
periodic
reports
to
congress
these
reports
may
be
either
written
or
oral
but
today
are
given
as
the
of
the
union
which
often
outlines
the
president
legislative
proposals
for
the
coming
year
additionally
the
president
may
attempt
to
have
congress
alter
proposed
legislation
by
threatening
to
veto
that
legislation
unless
requested
changes
are
the
century
critics
began
charging
that
too
many
legislative
and
budgetary
powers
have
slid
into
the
hands
of
presidents
that
should
belong
to
congress
as
the
head
of
the
executive
branch
presidents
control
a
vast
array
of
agencies
that
can
issue
regulations
with
little
oversight
from
congress
one
critic
charged
that
presidents
could
appoint
a
virtual
army
of
czars
each
wholly
unaccountable
to
congress

spearheading
major
policy
efforts

white
presidents

been
criticized
for
making
when
signing
congressional
legislation

how
they
understand
a
bill

this
practice

been
criticized
by
