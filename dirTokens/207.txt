an
example
of
a
portal
frame
steel
construction
is
a
method
of
building
and
designing
structures
primarily
using
steel
or
precast
concrete
although
they
can
also
be
constructed
using
laminated
timber
such
as
glulam
the
connections
between
the
columns
and
the
rafters
are
designed
to
be
moment
they
can
carry
bending
they
were
first
developed
in
the
and
have
now
become
the
most
common
form
of
enclosure
for
spans
of
to
of
these
very
strong
and
rigid
joints
some
of
the
bending
moment
in
the
rafters
is
transferred
to
the
columns
this
means
that
the
size
of
the
rafters
can
be
reduced
or
the
span
can
be
increased
for
the
same
size
rafters
this
makes
portal
frames
a
very
efficient
construction
technique
to
use
for
wide
span
frame
construction
is
therefore
typically
seen
in
warehouses
barns
and
other
places
where
large
open
spaces
are
required
at
low
cost
and
a
pitched
roof
is
portal
frames
are
used
for
buildings
but
they
can
be
used
for
buildings
with
several
floors
where
they
can
be
economic
if
the
floors
do
not
span
right
across
the
building
in
these
circumstances
a
skeleton
frame
with
internal
columns
would
be
a
more
economic
choice
a
typical
configuration
might
be
where
there
is
office
space
built
against
one
wall
of
a
frames
can
be
clad
with
all
sorts
of
material
but
the
most
popular
solution
for
reasons
of
economy
and
speed
is
some
form
of
lightweight
insulated
metal
cladding
with
cavity
masonry
work
to
the
bottom
of
the
wall
to
provide
security
and
impact
resistance
the
lightweight
cladding
would
be
carried
on
sheeting
rails
spanning
between
the
columns
of
the
portal
frames
can
be
defined
as
rigid
frames
that
have
the
basic
characteristics
of
a
rigid
joint
between
column
and
main
objective
of
this
form
of
design
is
to
reduce
bending
moment
in
the
beam
which
allows
the
frame
to
act
as
one
structural
transfer
of
stresses
from
the
beam
to
the
column
results
in
rotational
movement
at
the
foundation
which
can
be
overcome
by
the
introduction
