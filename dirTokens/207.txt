An

steel
construction
is
a
method
of
building
and
designing
structures
,
primarily
using
steel
or
steel-reinforced
precast
concrete
although
they
can
also
be
constructed
using
laminated
timber

as

The

They
were
first
developed
in
the
1960s
,
and
have
now
become
the
most
common
form
of
enclosure

of
these
very
strong
and
rigid
joints
,
some
of
the
bending
moment
in
the
rafters
is
transferred
to
the
columns
.
This
means
that
the
size
of
the
rafters
can
be
reduced
or
the
span
can
be
increased
for
the
same
size
rafters
.
This
makes
portal
frames
a
very
efficient
construction
technique
to
use
for
wide
span
frame
construction
is
therefore
typically
seen
in
warehouses
barns
and
other
places
where
large
,
open
spaces
are
required
at
low
cost

a
pitched
roof
is
portal
frames
are
used
for
single-story
buildings
but
they
can
be
used
for
low-rise
buildings
with
several
floors
where
they
can
be
economic
if
the
floors
do
not
span
right
across
the
building
-LRB-
in
these
circumstances
a
skeleton
frame
,
with
internal
columns
,
would
be
a
more
economic
choice

A
typical
configuration
might

where

frames
can
be
clad
with
all
sorts
of
material
but
the
most
popular
solution
,
for
reasons
of
economy
and
speed
,
is
some
form
of
lightweight
insulated
metal
cladding
with
cavity
masonry
work
to
the
bottom
2m
of
the
wall
to
provide
security
and
impact

The
lightweight
cladding
would
be
carried
on
sheeting
rails
spanning
between
the
columns
of
the
portal
frames
can
be
defined
as
two-dimensional
rigid
frames
that
have
the
basic
characteristics
of
a
rigid
joint
between
column
and
main
objective
of
this
form
of
design
is
to
reduce
bending
moment
in
the
beam
,
which
allows
the
frame
to
act
as
one
structural
transfer
of
stresses
from
the
beam
to
the
column
results
in
rotational
movement
at
the

which
can
be
overcome
by
the
introduction
of

buildings

the

D
are
not
rigid
,
they
will
``

and
the

when
subjected

This

If

resisted
essentially
by

in

the

significantly

this
