High
Speed
was
a
proposed
government
backed
system
that
would
have
connected
Miami
,
Orlando
,
and
Tampa
.
The
first
phase
was
planned
to
connect
Orlando
and
Tampa
and
was
offered
federal
funding
,
but
it
was
turned
down
by
Governor
Rick
Scott
in
2011
.
The
second
phase
of
the
line
was
envisioned
to
connect
Miami
.
By
2014
,
a
private
project
known
as
Aboard
by
a
company
of
the
historic
East
Coast
began
construction
of
a
line
in
South

that
is
planned
to
eventually
terminate
at

The

all

Because
