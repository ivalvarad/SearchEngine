shortened

originating

modern
encyclopedia
was
developed
from
the
dictionary
in
the
century
historically
both
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
have
been
researched
and
written
by
content
experts
but
they
are
significantly
different
in
structure
a
dictionary
is
a
linguistic
work
which
primarily
focuses
on
alphabetical
listing
of
words
and
their
definitions
synonymous
words
and
those
related
by
the
subject
matter
are
to
be
found
scattered
around
the
dictionary
giving
no
obvious
place
for
treatment
thus
a
dictionary
typically
provides
limited
information
analysis
or
background
for
the
word
defined
while
it
may
offer
a
definition
it
may
leave
the
reader
lacking
in
understanding
the
meaning
significance
or
limitations
of
a
term
and
how
the
term
relates
to
a
broader
field
of
knowledge
an
encyclopedia
is
allegedly
not
written
in
order
to
convince
although
one
of
its
goals
is
indeed
to
convince
its
reader
about
its
own
veracity
in
the
terms
of
aristotle
of
a
dictionary
should
persuade
the
reader
through
logos
conveying
only
appropriate
emotions
it
will
be
expected
to
have
a
lack
of
pathos
it
should
not
stir
up
irrelevant
emotions
and
to
have
little
ethos
except
that
of
the
dictionary
address
those
needs
an
encyclopedia
article
is
typically
not
limited
to
simple
definitions
and
is
not
limited
to
defining
an
individual
word
but
provides
a
more
extensive
meaning
for
a
or
discipline
in
addition
to
defining
and
listing
synonymous
terms
for
the
topic
the
article
is
able
to
treat
the
topic
more
extensive
meaning
in
more
depth
and
convey
the
most
relevant
accumulated
knowledge
on
that
subject
an
encyclopedia
article
also
often
includes
many
maps
and
illustrations
as
well
as
bibliography
and
statistics
major
elements
define
an
encyclopedia
its
subject
matter
its
scope
its
method
of
organization
and
its
method
of
can
be
general
containing
articles
on
topics
in
every
field
the
and
german
brockhaus
are
examples
general
encyclopedias
often
contain
guides
on
how
to
do
a
variety
of
things
as
well
as
embedded
dictionaries
and
gazetteers
there
are
also
encyclopedias
that
cover
a
wide
variety
of
topics
but
from
a
particular
cultural
ethnic
or
national
perspective
such
as
the
soviet
or
of
encyclopedic
scope
aim
to
convey
the
important
accumulated
knowledge
for
their
subject
domain
such
as
an
encyclopedia
of
medicine
philosophy
or
law
works
vary
in
the
breadth
of
material
and
the
depth
of
discussion
depending
on
the
for
example
the
produced
by
for
the
institutes
of
systematic
method
of
organization
is
essential
to
making
an
encyclopedia
usable
as
a
work
of
reference
there
have
historically
been
two
main
methods
of
organizing
printed
encyclopedias
the
alphabetical
method
consisting
of
a
number
of
separate
articles
organized
in
alphabetical
order
or
organization
by
hierarchical
categories
the
former
method
is
today
the
most
common
by
far
especially
for
general
works
the
fluidity
of
electronic
media
however
allows
new
possibilities
for
multiple
methods
of
organization
of
the
same
content
further
electronic
media
offer
previously
unimaginable
capabilities
for
search
indexing
and
the
epigraph
from
horace
on
the
title
page
of
the
century
suggests
the
importance
of
the
structure
of
an
encyclopedia
what
grace
may
be
added
to
commonplace
matters
by
the
power
of
order
and
modern
multimedia
and
the
information
age
have
evolved
they
have
had
an
effect
on
the
collection
verification
summation
and
presentation
of
information
of
all
kinds
projects
such
as
encarta
and
wikipedia
are
examples
of
new
forms
of
the
encyclopedia
as
becomes
simpler
the
method
of
production
for
an
encyclopedia
historically
has
been
supported
in
both
and
contexts
the
soviet
mentioned
above
was
entirely
state
sponsored
while
the
britannica
was
supported
as
a
institution
by
comparison
wikipedia
is
supported
by
volunteers
contributing
in
a
environment
under
the
organization
of
the
wikimedia
works
entitled
dictionaries
are
actually
similar
to
encyclopedias
especially
those
concerned
with
a
particular
field
such
as
the
of
the
middle
the
of
american
naval
fighting
and
law
the
australia
national
dictionary
became
an
after
its
first
edition
in
recognition
of
the
use
of
proper
nouns
in
common
communication
and
the
words
derived
from
such
proper
are
some
broad
differences
between
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
most
noticeably
encyclopedia
articles
are
longer
fuller
and
more
thorough
than
entries
in
most
there
are
differences
in
content
as
well
generally
speaking
dictionaries
provide
linguistic
information
about
words
themselves
while
encyclopedias
focus
more
on
the
thing
for
which
those
words
thus
while
dictionary
entries
are
inextricably
fixed
to
the
word
described
encyclopedia
articles
can
be
given
a
different
entry
name
as
such
dictionary
entries
are
not
fully
translatable
into
other
languages
but
encyclopedia
articles
can
practice
however
the
distinction
is
not
concrete
as
there
is
no
difference
between
factual
encyclopedic
information
and
linguistic
information
such
as
appears
in
thus
encyclopedias
may
contain
material
that
is
also
found
in
dictionaries
and
vice
in
particular
dictionary
entries
often
contain
factual
information
about
the
