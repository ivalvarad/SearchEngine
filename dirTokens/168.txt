encyclopedia
was
developed
from
the
dictionary
in
the
18th
century
.
Historically
,
both
encyclopedias
and
dictionaries
have
been
researched
and
written
by
well-educated
,
well-informed
content
experts
but
they
are
significantly
different
in
structure
.
A
dictionary
is
a
linguistic
work
which
primarily
focuses
on
alphabetical
listing
of
words
and
their
definitions
Synonymous
words
and
those
related
by
the
subject
matter
are
to
be
found
scattered
around
the
dictionary
,
giving
no
obvious
place
for
in-depth
treatment
.
Thus
,
a
dictionary
typically
provides
limited
information
analysis
or
background
for
the
word
defined
.
While
it
may
offer
a
definition
,
it
may
leave
the
reader
lacking
in
understanding
the
meaning
,
significance
or
limitations
of
a
term
and
how
the
term
relates
to
a
broader
field
of
knowledge
.
An
encyclopedia
is
,
allegedly
,
not
written
in
order
to
convince
,
although
one
of
its
goals
is
indeed
to
convince
its
reader
about
its
own
veracity
.
In
the
terms
of
Aristotle
of
a
dictionary
should
persuade
the
reader
through
logos

conveying
only
appropriate
emotions
-RRB-
;
it
will
be
expected
to
have
a
lack
of
pathos
-LRB-
it
should
not
stir
up
irrelevant

-RRB-
,
and
to
have
little
ethos
except
that
of
the
dictionary
address
those
needs
,
an
encyclopedia
article
is
typically
not
limited
to
simple
definitions
,
and
is
not
limited
to
defining
an
individual
word
,
but
provides
a
more
extensive
meaning
for
a
or
discipline
In

to
defining
and
listing
synonymous
terms
for

,
the

essential

making
an

usable

There
have
historically
been
two
main
methods
of
organizing
printed
encyclopedias
:
the
alphabetical
method
-LRB-
consisting
of
a
number
of
separate
articles
,
organized
in

-RRB-
,
or
organization
by
hierarchical
categories
.
The
former
method
is
today
the
most
common
by
far
,
especially
for
general
works
.
The
fluidity
of
electronic
media
,
however
,
allows
new
possibilities
for
multiple
methods
of
organization
of
the
same
content
.

of
new

The
method

production

an

historically
has
been
supported
in
both
for-profit
and
non-profit
contexts
