explicitly

focuses

are

not
so
much
to
resolve

conflicting
editors
but
to
weed
out

editors
while
allowing
potentially
productive
editors
back
in

therefore
the
committee
does
not
dictate
the
content
of

although
it
sometimes
condemns
content
changes
when
it

asked
on

wales
once
argued
that
only
a
community
a
dedicated
group
of
a
few
hundred
volunteers
makes
the
bulk
of
contributions
to
wikipedia
and
that
the
project
is
therefore
much
like
any
traditional
in
a
slate
magazine
article
reported
that
according
to
researchers
in
palo
alto
percent
of

users
are
responsible
for
about
half
of
the

this
method
of
evaluating
contributions
was
later
disputed
by

noted
that
several

ever

his

only

be

several
attempts
to
explain

been
offered
one
possible
explanation
is
that
some

become
turned
off
by

another
explanation
according
to
eric

is
found
in

who
fail
to
comply
with

cultural
rituals
such
as
signing

outperformed

which
he

was
an
important

contrasting

treatment

that
of
historian
in

he

that

richer
contextualization
his
artful

his

prose
that

out
its

conclusion
some

him
as
an
opportunistic
bloodthirsty
outlaw
while

continue
to
view
him
as
a
daring
soldier

local
folk
critics
have
made
similar
charges
that
even
if
wikipedia

are
factually
accurate
they

the
five
forces
are
centered
around
the
issue
of
competitive
rivalry
within
the
encyclopedia
industry
where
wikipedia
is
seen
as
having
redefined

radical
innovation
the
parameters

the

force

the

largely
eluded

innovation

porter
third
force
is
the
threat
of

it
is

early

fourth
force
in

five
forces
is
the
bargaining
power
of
consumers
who
use
the
services
provided
by

which
has
historically
largely
been
nullified
by
the
wikipedia
founding
principle
of
an
open
invitation
to
expand

edit
its
content
expressed
in
its
moniker
of

the
fifth
force
in
the
five

is
defined
as
the
bargaining
power
of
suppliers
presently
seen
as
the
open
domain
of
both
the
global
internet
as
a
whole
and
the
resources
of

therefore
it
is
not
seen
as
a

this
made
it
a
poor
choice
for

the

requires

the

for

the

gained
popularity
among

others
distributing
creative

on
the

the
wikipedia

sought
the
switch
to
the
creative
because
the
two

gfdl

were
incompatible
in
november
following
the
request
of

most
obvious

also
an

about

the
worry

in
number
of
interactive
multimedia
encyclopedias
incorporating
entries
written
by
the
public
existed
long
before
wikipedia
was
founded
the
first
of
these
was
the
domesday
which
included
text
entered
on
computers
and
photographs
from
over
contributors
in
the
uk
and
covered
the
geography
art
and
culture
of
the
uk
this
was
the
first
interactive
multimedia
encyclopedia
and
was
also
the
first
major
multimedia
document
connected
through
internal
links
with
the
majority
of
articles
being
accessible
through
an
interactive
map
of
the
uk
the
user
interface
and
part
of
the
content
of
the
domesday
project
were
emulated
on
a
website
until
of
the
most
successful
early
online
encyclopedias
incorporating
entries
by
the
public
was
which
was
created
by
the
encyclopedia
is
relatively
focusing
on
articles
which
are
both
witty
and
informative
was
created
in
all
of
these
projects
had
similarities
with
wikipedia
but
were
not
wikis
and
neither
gave
full
editorial
privileges
to
public
gne
an
encyclopedia
which
was
not
a
wiki
also
created
in
january
with
nupedia
and
wikipedia
early
in
its
history
however
it
has
been
websites
centered
on
collaborative
development
have
drawn
inspiration
from
wikipedia
some
such
as
hudong
and
likewise
employ
no
formal
review
process
although
some
like
conservapedia
are
not
as
open
others
use
more
traditional
such
as
of

the
online
wiki
encyclopedias
scholarpedia
and

the

was
started
by
