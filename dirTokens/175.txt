cultural
rituals
,

The

Porter

the

early

existed
long
before

was

.
The
first
of
these
was
the

Domesday
which
included
text

entered
on
computers

and
photographs
from
over
1million
contributors
in

,
and
covered
the

of

This
was

Its

is
a
certain
mindset
associated
with
unmoderated
Usenet
groups
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
that
infects
the
collectively-managed
Wikipedia
project
:
if
you
react
strongly
to
trolling

that
reflects
poorly

you
,
not

If

demand
that
something
be
done
about
constant

by

behavior

the

The

anti-elitism

or
lack
of

There
is
a
deeper
problem
-LSB-
...
-RSB-
which
explains
both
of
the
above-elaborated
problems
.
Namely
,
as
a
community
,
Wikipedia
lacks
the
habit
or
tradition
of
respect
for
expertise
.
As
a
community
,
far
from
being
elitist
,
it
is
anti-elitist
-LRB-
which
,
in
this
context
,
means
that
expertise
is
not
accorded
any
special
respect
,
and
snubs
and
disrespect
of
expertise
is
tolerated
-RRB-

This
is
one
of
my
failures
:
a
policy
that
I
attempted
to
institute
in

first
year
,
but
for
which
I
did
not
muster
adequate
support
,
was
the
policy
of
respecting
and
deferring
politely
to
experts
