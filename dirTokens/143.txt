not

did

not

to

tensions
with

colonial
administration
over
lafone
failure
to
establish
any
permanent

and
over
the
price
of
beef
supplied
to
the

moreover
although
his
concession
required
lafone
to
bring

from
the

most
of

tasked
in
to
produce
a
report
into

economic
development
of

his

report
criticised
the
large
farming
companies

recommended
transferring

from
absentee
landlords
to
local

shackleton
also
suggested
diversifying

moreover
he
recommended
the
establishment

natural

likely
the
result
