that
the
repeal
of
the
Population
Registration
Act
in
1991
removed
any
legal
basis
for
specifying
`
race

.
The
Identification
Act
of
1997
makes
no

race

On

the

Act
speaks
of
`

`

Apartheid
and
the
racial
identification
which
underpinned
it
explicitly
linked
race
with
differential
access
to
resources
and
power

If
the
post-apartheid
order
was
committed
to
remedying
this
,
race
would
have
to
be
included
in
surveys

censuses

that
progress

eradicating
the
consequences
of
apartheid
could
be
measured
