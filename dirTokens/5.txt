when

still
advocated

as

Portal
's
view
of
strategic
bombing
changed
;
he
felt
that
bombers
could
also
play
a
more
auxiliary
role
in
the
allied
offensive
.
-LRB-
Much
of
what
is
known
about
Portal
's
thinking
is
based
on
memoranda
he
wrote
.
-RRB-
He
argued
for
the
new
approach
on
the
basis
of
the
huge
increase
in
the
size
of
the
bomber
force
,
which
would
carry
out
not
just
precision
bombing
but
also
indiscriminate
by
night
of
all
German
cities
with
populations
exceeding
100,000
.
Portal
thought
that
the
resulting
damage
to
the
German
war
effort
and
civilian
morale
would
lead
to
victory
within
six
months
.

Churchill
subsequently
distanced
himself
from
