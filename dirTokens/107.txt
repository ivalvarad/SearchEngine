credited
with
conceiving
the

carving
the
likenesses
of
famous
people
into
the
region
of
South
Dakota
in
order
to
promote
tourism
in
the
region
.
Robinson
's
initial
idea
was
to
sculpt
the
Needles
however
,
Gutzon
Borglum
rejected
the
Needles
site
because
of
the
poor
quality
of
the
granite
and
strong
opposition
from
Native
American
groups
.
They
settled
on
the
Mount
Rushmore
location
,
which
also
has
the
advantage
of
facing
southeast
for
maximum
sun
exposure
.
Robinson
wanted
it
to
feature
western

like

would

Borglum
's
death
in

Although
the
initial
concept
called
for
