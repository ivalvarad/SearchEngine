dakota
historian
is
credited
with
conceiving
the
idea

carving
the
likenesses
of
famous
people
into
the
region
of
south
dakota
in
order
to
promote
tourism
in
the
region
robinson
initial
idea
was
to
sculpt
the
needles
however
gutzon
borglum
rejected
the
needles
site
because
of
the
poor
quality
of
the
granite
and
strong
opposition
from
native
american
groups
they
settled
on
the
mount
rushmore
location
which
also
has
the
advantage
of
facing
southeast
for
maximum
sun
exposure
robinson
wanted
it
to
feature
western
heroes
like
and
and
bill
but
borglum
decided
the
sculpture
should
have
a
more
national
focus
and
chose
the
four
presidents
whose
likenesses
would
be
carved
into
the
mountain
after
securing
federal
funding
through
the
enthusiastic
sponsorship
of

rushmore
great

construction
on
the
memorial
began
in
and
the
presidents
faces
were
completed
between
and
upon
gutzon
borglum
death
in
march
his
son
took
over
construction
although
the
initial
concept
called
for
each
president
to
be
depicted
from
head
to
waist
lack
of

forced
construction
to

the

after

took

journey
that

at

a

from

a

is
still

on

see
section
controversy
below
among
american
settlers
the
peak
was
known
variously
as
cougar
mountain
sugarloaf
mountain
slaughterhouse
mountain
and
keystone

it
was
named
mount
rushmore
during

husband
of

bill
conceived
the
idea
for
mount

in
to
promote

in

dakota
in
robinson
persuaded
sculptor
to
travel
to
the
black
hills
region
to
ensure
the
carving
could
be
accomplished
borglum
had
been
involved
in
sculpting
the
memorial
a
massive
memorial
to
confederate
leaders
on
in
georgia
but
was
in
disagreement
with
the
officials
construction
of
the
mount
rushmore
original
plan
was
to
perform
the
carvings
in
granite
pillars
known
as
the
needles
however
borglum
realized
that
the
eroded
needles
were
too
thin
to
support
sculpting
he
chose
mount
rushmore
a
grander
location
partly
because
it
faced
southeast
and
enjoyed
maximum
exposure
to
the
sun
borglum
said
upon
seeing
mount
rushmore
america
will
march
along
that
congress
authorized
the
mount
rushmore
national
memorial
commission
on
march
president
coolidge
insisted
that
along
with
washington
two
republicans

one
democrat
be
october
and
october
gutzon
borglum
and
sculpted
the
colossal
foot
high
carvings
of
and
to
represent
the
first
years
of
american
history
these
presidents
were
selected
by
borglum
because
of
their
role
in
preserving
the
republic
and
expanding
its
the
carving
of
mount
rushmore
involved
the
use
of
dynamite
followed
by
the
process
of
in
total
about
short
tons
t
of
rock
were
blasted
off
the
the
image
of
thomas
jefferson
was
originally
intended
to
appear
in
the
area
at
washington
right
but
after
the
work
there
was
begun
the
rock
was
found
to
be
unsuitable
so
the
work
on
the
jefferson
figure
was
dynamited
and
a
new
figure
was
sculpted
to
washington
the
national
park
service
took
mount
rushmore
under
its
jurisdiction
julian
spotts
helped
with
the
project
by
improving
its
infrastructure
for
example
he
had
the
tram
upgraded
so
it
could
reach
the
top
of
mount
rushmore
for
the
ease
of
workers
by
july
washington
face
had
been
completed
and
was
dedicated
the
face
of
thomas
jefferson
was
dedicated
in
and
the
face
of
abraham
lincoln
was
dedicated
on
september
in
a
bill
was
introduced
in
congress
to
add
the
head
of
leader
but
a
rider
was
passed
on
an
appropriations
bill
requiring
federal

be
used

his

continued
the
project
originally
it
was
planned
that
the
figures
would
be
carved
from
head

insufficient
funding
forced
the

to
