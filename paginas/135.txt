[ 2 ]   It is found in a variety of habitats, including dense forest, in Bolivia and Peru at elevations from 450 to 2,100 metres (1,480 to 6,890ft) on the eastern side of the Andes .   [ 1 ]   The species is at least partly arboreal.

The fur is short and dense, and consists of a mixture of long slender hairs and spines, giving the mouse a bristly appearance. The upper parts are olive-brown and the underparts are buffish-ochre with fewer spines. The tail is dark above and slightly paler below, with rings of scales, and hairs increasing in length towards the tip and ending with a tuft of hairs. The fore feet have five long digits with broad, blunt tips and short, narrow claws that hardly project beyond the tips of the digits. The hind feet are short and broad and have five digits with blunt, calloused tips, the hallux (big toe) being shorter than the others and having a nail rather than a claw. The female has three pairs of .   [ 3 ]     Distribution   [  edit  ]   known range consists oft four sites on the eastern slopes of the Andes in South America.

The morphology of the feet, the forward-pointing eyes and the short snout make it likely that it is an arboreal species. Three of the specimens examined were caught in and the fourth one was a metre above the ground, in a clump of bamboo. The noticeably long tongue may be used to extract insects from crevices, but very little is known of this animal and its natural   [ 3 ]     Status   [  edit  ]   only known from a few isolated records, is listed by the Union for Conservation of as being of This is because of its tolerance of several types of habitats, and because in the absence of any particular threats, it seems unlikely that it is declining at a sufficient rate to qualify for being included in a more threatened   [ 1 ]     References   [  edit  ]       a       b       c      J.; Vargas, J.; Patterson, B.
