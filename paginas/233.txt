It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, environmental arrangement and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word  technology  comes from Greek  τεχνολογία from  τέχνη meaning "art, skill, craft", and  -λογία -logía ) meaning "study of-". The term can be applied either generally or to many specific areas, examples of which include and . human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the the telephone and the Internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to . has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's and has allowed the rise of a leisure class Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the or worsens it. Neo-Luddism anarcho-primitivism and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other   about                 edit         The  Canada VZ-9  was a VTOL aircraft developed by Aircraft Ltd. as part of a secret U.S. military project carried out in the early years of the The Avrocar intended to exploit the to provide lift and thrust from a single "turborotor" blowing exhaust out the rim of the disk-shaped aircraft to provide anticipated VTOL performance. In the air, it would have resembled a Originally designed as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the Air eventually abandoned it. Development was then taken up by the for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems that limited it to a degraded, low-performance subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961. Through the history of the program, the project was referred to by a number of different names. Avro referred to the efforts as Project Y, with individual vehicles known as Spade and Omega. Project Y-2 was later funded by the U.S. Air Force, who referred to it as WS-606A, Project 1794 and Project Silver Bug. When the U.S. Army joined the efforts it took on its final name "Avrocar", and the designation "VZ-9", part of the U.S. Army's VTOL projects in the VZ series.   ...Archive/Nominations     More...        edit    this      October 1957 – The launches     the first Earth  October 1826 – The   (pictured) the first railroad to use the and the begins October 2013 – and win the Prize in for the discovery of the    October 1793 – applies for a patent on the   dramatically altering the economy of the United          edit     you       that Japan   program in China during War used plague fleas and cholera flies to kill nearly 500,000 that  hydrogen  was used to disinfect buildings contaminated in the anthrax in the   used statistical studies to show the probability of death from was significantly less than from smallpox ?   ...Archive/Nominations     More...      edit           was an astronomer mathematician inventor geographer cartographer artist poet statesman and from Nanyang Henan and lived during the Han (AD25–220) of China After beginning his career as a minor civil servant, he eventually became Chief Astronomer, Prefect of the Majors for Official Carriages, and then Palace Attendant at the imperial court. His uncompromising stances on certain historical and calendrical issues led to Zhang being considered a controversial figure, which prevented him from becoming an official court historian. Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered to represent astronomical observation; improved the inflow by adding another tank; and invented the world's first seismometer which discerned the of an earthquake 500km (310mi) away. Furthermore, he improved previous Chinese calculations of the for His  fu  (rhapsody) and  shi  poetry were renowned and commented on by later Chinese writers. Zhang received many posthumous honors for his scholarship and ingenuity, and is considered a polymath by some scholars.   ...Archive/Nominations     More...        edit    Wikiprojects        Technology    Architecture   Computing     Electronics     Energy   of   Metalworking   Telecommunications   Woodworking   are WikiProjects ?      edit          Sergey  is a twin-engine, two-seat supermaneuverable   developed by Russia's Aviation It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and deep   ...Archive/Nominations     More...        edit         “ will move faster than governments, so don't legislate before you understand the ”   comment to the media   ...Archive/Nominations     More...      edit    Categories        Computing  · of · Companies · · · · · and · Data · · · · Internet · Languages · Multimedia · Networks · · Platforms · lifecycle · · Software · Security More...
