With the assistance of a liberal financial loan from the British, plus their aid in the form of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies, he began a 20-year task of creating a respectable regular force by instituting measures that formed the long-term basis of the military system. These included increasing the equalization of military obligation by setting up a system known as the hasht nafari (whereby one man in every eight between the ages of 20 and 40 took his turn at military service); constructing an arsenal in Kabul to reduce dependence on foreign sources for small arms and other ordnance; introducing supervised training courses; organizing troops into divisions, brigades, and regiments, including battalions of artillery; developing pay schedules; and introducing an elementary (and harsh) disciplinary       Afghan Army soldiers in the improvements to the army were made by King in the early 20th century just before the Anglo-Afghan King Amanullah fought against the British in 1919, resulting in Afghanistan becoming fully independent after the of was signed.

In 1985 Army units were relieved of security guard duties, making more available for combat the 1980s war in the army fought against the mujahideen rebel groups. Deserters or defectors became a severe problem. The Afghan army's casualties were as high as 50–60,000 and another 50,000 deserted the armed forces.

During the mujahideen attack against Jalalabad between March and June 1989, three firing batteries manned by Afghan crews advised by Soviets fired approximately 438   [ 25 ]   Soon Scuds were in use in all the heavily contested areas of Afghanistan. After January 1992, the Soviet advisors were withdrawn, reducing the Afghan army's ability to use their ballistic missiles. On April 24, 1992, the mujahideen forces of Shah captured the main Scud stockpile at Afshur. As the communist government collapsed, the few remaining Scuds and their TELs were divided among the rival factions fighting for power. However, the lack of trained personnel prevented a sustained use of such weapons, and, between April 1992 and 1996, only 44 Scuds were fired in   [ 26 ]     and   [  edit  ]   Spring 1992, the Afghan Army consisted of five corps - at Jalalabad, 2nd at Khandahar, at   [ 27 ]   at Herat, and at Kunduz - as well as five smaller operations groups, including one at Charikar which had been 5th Corps until it was reduced in status. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Corps, and the operations groups at Sarobi and Khost nearly completely disintegrated in   [ 28 ]   Formations in and around Kabul joined different mujahideen militias while forces in the north and west remained intact for a longer period.

In mid 2001, Ahmed   [ 34 ]    army (as a state institution, organized, armed, and commanded by the state) does not exist in Afghanistan today. Neither the Taliban-led "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan" nor the "Islamic State of Afghanistan" headed by the ousted President Rabbani has the political legitimacy or administrative efficiency of a state. The militia formations they command are composed of odd assortments of armed groups with varying level of loyalties, political commitment, professional skills, and organizational integrity. Many of them feel free to switch sides, shift loyalties, and join or leave the group spontaneously. The country suffers from the absence of a top political layer capable of controlling individual and group violence. .. Although both sides identify their units with military formations of the old regime, there is hardly any organizational or professional continuity from the past.

For example, the ministry in July 2002 recognised a 25th Division in Khost province, formed by the Karzai-appointed governor, to unseat a local warlord, Padshah Khan Zadran, who was then occupying the governor’s residence.

Approximately 1,000 ANA soldiers were deployed in the US-led Warrior marking the first major combat operation for Afghan troops. Initial recruiting problems lay in the lack of cooperation from regional warlords and inconsistent international support. The problem of desertion dogged the force in its early days: in the summer of 2003, the desertion rate was estimated to be 10% and in mid-March 2004, estimate suggested that 3,000 soldiers had deserted. Some recruits were under 18 years of age and many could not read or write.
