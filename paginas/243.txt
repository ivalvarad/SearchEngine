The portal is often used to present a .   [ 1 ]   This is done by intercepting most packets regardless of address or port, until the user opens a browser and tries to access the web. At that time the browser is redirected to a web page which may require authentication and/or payment or simply display an use and require the user to agree. Captive portals are used at many Wi-Fi hotspots and can be used to control wired access (e.g. apartment houses, hotel rooms, business centers, "open" Ethernet jacks) as the itself must be presented to the client, either that login page is locally stored in the gateway or the hosting that page must be whitelisted via a to bypass the authentication process. Depending on the feature set of the gateway, multiple web servers can be whitelisted (say for iframes or links within the login page). In addition to whitelisting the URLs of web hosts, some gateways can whitelist The of attached clients can also be set to bypass the login technique has occasionally been referred to as UAM (Universal Access Method) in implementations and standards  Contents   1 Implementation    1.1     1.2 by     1.3 of captive     2     3 Limitations     4     5 References     Implementation   [  edit  ]   is more than one way to implement a captive    [  edit  ]   traffic can also be redirected using on the layer 3  by   [  edit  ]   a client requests a website, DNS is queried by the browser. The firewall will make sure that only the DNS server(s) provided by DHCP can be used by unauthenticated clients (or, alternatively, it will forward all DNS requests by unauthenticated clients to that DNS server). This DNS server will return the IP address of the Captive Portal page as a result of all DNS order to perform redirection by DNS the captive portal is using to perform a To limit the impact of DNS poisoning typically a TTL of 0 is  of captive   [  edit  ]   portals have been known to have incomplete firewall rule sets. In some deployments the rule set will route DNS requests from clients to the Internet, or the provided DNS server will fulfill arbitrary DNS requests from the client. This allows a client to bypass the captive portal and access the open Internet by tunneling arbitrary traffic within DNS captive portals may be configured to allow appropriately equipped user agents to detect the captive portal and automatically authenticate. User agents and supplemental applications such as Apple's Captive Portal Assistant can sometimes transparently bypass the display of captive portal content against the wishes of the service operator as long as they have access to correct credentials, or they may attempt to authenticate with incorrect or obsolete credentials, resulting in unintentional consequences such as accidental account captive portal that uses MAC addresses to track connected devices can sometimes be circumvented by connecting via hard-wire a router that allows setting of the router MAC address. Many router firmwares call this MAC cloning. Once a computer or tablet has been authenticated to the captive portal using a valid username and valid password, the MAC address of that computer or tablet can be entered into the router which will often continue to be connected through the captive portal as it shows to have the same MAC address as the computer or tablet that was previously    [  edit  ]   prevalent use of captive portals is for user authentication, however captive portals are gaining increasing use on free open wireless networks where instead of authenticating users, they often display a message from the provider along with the terms of use. Although the legal standing is unclear, a click through a page may display terms of use and release the provider from any [     ] Institutions will often require acknowledgement of an use in addition to portals are sometimes used to enforce payment or negotiate the level and duration of authorization with a prospective user. Emergency may use captive portals to interrupt users' browsing experience until they have acknowledged receipt of an emergency implementing NAC often use captive portals to collect machine information, to supply software assessment agents which the supplicant user must run before gaining admission to the network, to provide online assistance for self-remediation of security problems, and to inform quarantined users when their network access has been of advertising content via captive portals is not  Limitations   [  edit  ]   of these implementations merely require users to pass an SSL encrypted login page, after which their IP and are allowed to pass through the gateway This has been shown to be exploitable with a simple Once the IP and MAC addresses of other connecting computers are found to be authenticated, any machine can spoof the MAC address and IP of the authenticated target, and be allowed a route through the gateway. For this reason some captive portal solutions created extended authentication mechanisms to limit the risk for portals require the use of a browser; this is usually the first application that users start, but users who first use an email client or other will find the connection not working without explanation, and will need to open a browser to validate. A similar problem can occur if the client joins the network with pages already loaded into its browser, causing undefined behavior when such a page tries HTTP requests to its origin that have Wi-Fi and a but do not have a web browser that supports HTTPS cannot use many captive portals. Such platforms include the running a game that uses Wi-Fi Non-browser authentication is possible using WISPr an XML authentication protocol for this purpose, or MAC-based authentication or authentications based on other also exists the option of the platform vendor entering into a service contract with the operator of a large number of captive portal hotspots to allow free or discounted access to the platform vendor's servers via the hotspot's such as the deal between Nintendo and Wayport .
