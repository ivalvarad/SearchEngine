Days are conventionally identified using the but day can also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60minutes. The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60, but with an occasional leap second, it may be 61 or 59   [ 13 ]   Thus, in the UTC time scale, the second and all smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond, etc.) are of constant duration, but the minute and all larger time units (hour, day, week, etc.) are of variable duration. Decisions to introduce a leap second are announced at least six months in advance in "BulletinC" produced by the Earth Rotation and Reference Systems .   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]   The leap seconds cannot be predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of rotation of the   [ 16 ]    all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 SI seconds with exactly 60seconds in each minute. However, because the solar is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds, occasionally the last minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61seconds. The extra second is called a leap second. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length (about 2milliseconds each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second. The last minute of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59seconds to cover the remote possibility of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been necessary. The irregular day lengths mean that fractional Julian days do not work properly with 1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from Atomic (TAI), which is a scale tracking notional on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid In order to maintain a close approximation to UT1 (equivalent to GMT UTC occasionally has discontinuities where it changes from one linear function of TAI to another. These discontinuities take the form of leap seconds implemented by a UTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities in UTC have occurred only at the end of June or December, although there is provision for them to happen at the end of March and September as well as a second   [ 17 ]     [ 18 ]   The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and publishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 – UTC, and introduces discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (−0.9s, with TAI, UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users who require an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates an approximation using techniques such as GPS or radio Such approximations are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time   [ 19 ]   The time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations; later corrections may be applied using the Bureau of Weights and (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating   [ 20 ]   (See the article on Atomic for of a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid motion, will not maintain synchronicity with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is used to provide UTC when required, on locations such as those of is not possible to compute the exact elapsed between two UTC timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval. Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead. TAI is also commonly used by systems that cannot handle leap seconds. always remains exactly 19 seconds behind TAI (neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in most common and legal-trade purposes, the fractional second difference between UTC and UT GMT is inconsequentially small.

Time zones were identified by successive letters of the alphabet and the Greenwich time zone was marked by a Z as it was the point of origin. The letter also refers to the "zone description" of zero hours, which has been used since 1920 (see zone Since the phonetic word for Z is "Zulu", UTC is sometimes known as "Zulu time". This is especially true in aviation, where "Zulu" is the universal   [ 23 ]   This ensures all pilots regardless of location are using the same thus avoiding confusion when flying between time   [ 24 ]   See the of military time for letters used in addition to Z in qualifying time zones other than electronic devices that only allow the current time zone to be configured using maps or city names, UTC can be selected indirectly by selecting Reykjavík Iceland which is always on UTC and does not use daylight saving   [ 25 ]     saving  article: saving  does not change with a change of seasons, but or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time).

This agreed with civil Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours after mean midnight of the same date until 1 January 1925, whereas nautical GMT began at mean noon, 12hours before mean midnight of the same date, at least until 1805 in the but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their .   [ 27 ]   In 1928, the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union to refer to GMT, with the day starting at   [ 28 ]   Until the 1950s, broadcast were based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the 1955, the caesium was invented. This provided a form of timekeeping that was both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the Bureau of and started to develop atomic frequency time scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating the WWV time signals, named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them. In 1960, the U.S.Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical Laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and frequency changes were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally referred to as "Coordinated Universal   [ 29 ]    a controversial decision, the frequency of the signals was initially set to match the rate of UT, but then kept at the same frequency by the use of atomic clocks and deliberately allowed to drift away from UT. When the divergence grew significantly, the signal was phase shifted (stepped) by 20 ms to bring it back into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps were used before   [ 30 ]    1958, data was published linking the frequency for the caesium transition, newly established, with the ephemeris   [ 31 ]   The ephemeris second is the duration of time that, when used as the independent variable in the laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system, causes the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar system bodies. Within the limits of observing accuracy, ephemeris seconds are of constant length, as are atomic seconds. This publication allowed a value to be chosen for the length of the atomic second that would work properly with the celestial laws of   [ 32 ]    1961 the International de began coordinating the UTC process internationally (but the name Coordinated Universal Time was not adopted by the International Astronomical Union until   [ 33 ]      [ 34 ]   Time steps occurred every few months thereafter, and frequency changes at the end of each year. The jumps increased in size to 100ms. This UTC was intended to permit a very close approximation to   [ 29 ]    1967, the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock. The length of second so defined was practically equal to the second of ephemeris   [ 35 ]   This was the frequency that had been provisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon recognised that having two types of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI second used in TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought that it would be better for time signals to maintain a consistent frequency, and that that frequency should match the SIsecond. Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the approximation of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as "Stepped Atomic Time" (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used jumps of 200ms to stay synchronised with   [ 2 ]    was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in UTC (and SAT). In 1968, the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G.M.R.Winkler both independently proposed that steps should be of 1s   [ 36 ]   This system was eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining the UTC second equal to the TAI second. At the end of 1971, there was a final irregular jump of exactly 0.107758 TAI seconds, so that 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10 TAI exactly, making the difference between UTC and TAI an of seconds. At the same time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to exactly match TAI. UTC also started to track UT1 rather than UT2. Some time signals started to broadcast the DUT1 correction (UT1 − UTC) for applications requiring a closer approximation of UT1 than UTC now   [ 37 ]      [ 38 ]     number of leap  first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972. Since then, leap seconds have occurred on average about once every 19months, always on 30 June or 31 December. As of July 2015, there have been 26leap seconds in total, all positive, putting UTC 36seconds behind   [ 39 ]     Rationale        Graph showing the difference DUT1 between UT1 and UTC (in seconds). Vertical segments correspond to leap is very slowly decreasing because of this increases the length of the solar The length of the SIsecond was calibrated on the basis of the second of    [ 32 ]      [ 35 ]   and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by As a result, the SIsecond is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th   [ 40 ]   In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as "length of day" or "LOD") was approximately   [ 41 ]   For this reason, UT is now "slower" than TAI by the difference (or "excess" LOD) of excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400s accumulates over time, causing the UTC day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become desynchronised and run ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the LOD at 1.3ms above the nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3ms per day, getting a second ahead roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval, retarding UTC to keep it synchronised in the long   [ 42 ]   The actual varies on unpredictable factors such as and has to be observed, rather than as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a second every 800 days. It will take approximately 50,000 years for a mean solar day to lengthen by one second (at a rate of 2ms/cy, where cy means century). This rate fluctuates within the range of 1.7–2.3ms/cy. While the rate due to alone is about 2.3ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres since the last has temporarily reduced this to 1.7ms/cy over the last   [ 43 ]   The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period of time: Near the end of the 20thcentury, this difference was about 1/800 of a second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1second (and a leap second was then the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above the nominal 86,400s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical segments. (The slope became shallower in the 2000s, because of a slight acceleration of Earth's crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated difference. Leap seconds are timed to keep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted by this graph. The frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope of the diagonal graph segments, and thus to the excess  Future  also:  the Earth's rotation continues to slow, positive leap seconds are required more frequently. The long-term of of LOD is approximately +1.7ms per century. At the end of the 21st century, LOD will be roughly 86,400.004s, requiring leap seconds every 250 days. Over several centuries, the frequency of leap seconds will become time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year. The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December will be insufficient, and the March and September options will have to be used. In the 25thcentury, four leap seconds will be required every year, so the current quarterly options will be insufficient. Thereafter there will need to be the possibility of leap seconds at the end of any month. In about two thousand years, even that will be insufficient, and there will have to be leap seconds that are not at the end of a   [ 44 ]   In a few tens of thousands of years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401s, causing UTC to require more than one leap second per is a proposal to redefine UTC and abolish leap seconds, such that sundials would slowly get further out of sync with civil   [ 45 ]   The resulting gradual shift of the sun's movements relative to civil time is analogous to the shift of seasons relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the length. This would be a major practical change in civil timekeeping, but would take effect slowly over several centuries. UTC (and TAI) would be more and more ahead of UT; it would coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting slowly eastward (reaching Paris and   [ 46 ]   Thus, the time system would lose its fixed connection to the geographic coordinates based on the The difference between UTC and UT could reach 0.5 hour after the year 2600 and 6.5 hours around   [ 44 ]     ITU‑R Study Group7 and Working Party7A were unable to reach consensus on whether to advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly; the chairman of Study Group7 elected to advance the question to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly (20 January   [ 47 ]   but consideration of the proposal was postponed by the ITU until the World Radio Conference in 2015, convening on 2   [ 48 ]    April 2001, Rob Seaman of the Optical Astronomy proposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice   [ 49 ]         Reference     Time Coordinated     Radiocommunication   References   Notes     ^         a       b       Seidelmann     ^    Radiocommunication Assembly .     ^    Service Dept. c. .     ^    Institute of Standards and Technology .     ^    Time .     ^    time: "heure " " Yachting and Boating World Retrieved .          ^    Institute of Standards and Technology .     ^    resolutions .     ^    NTP Works .     ^    Time .     ^    .     ^    Radiocommunication Assembly     ^    Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service .     ^     Seidelmann     ^     Seidelmann chapter     ^    of TAI-UTC c. .     ^     Seidelmann pp.217,     ^     Seidelmann     ^    .     ^    .     ^        ^     Civilian Time Designations .     ^    .     ^    .     ^    time .     ^        ^     Seidelmann      a       b       Seidelmann     ^    Guinot  Quinn .     ^   second is the duration of 9 192  631  770  periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom."
