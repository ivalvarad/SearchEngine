Little Sky fled the reservation he lived on, moving to York where he took a job as a construction worker. He was followed by Puma, who had set out in pursuit of Little Sky out of fear that the powers he'd soon manifest would prove dangerous. When Puma finally tracked him down at Little Sky's powers activated for the first time, opening a portal to the dimension where the U-Foes had been exiled, freeing them. The U-Foes attempted to kill Little Sky to keep him from using his powers to banish them again, and the Avengers and Puma were forced to team up to protect him. During the fight, Little Sky escaped, using his powers and began traveling the   [ 1 ]    the way he picked up a variety of weapons, including a gun that fired 'energy harpoons,' and learned to control his powers. In one dimension he encountered Kistur the leader of an intergalactic gang of criminals who was armed with one of the android Darkhawk bodies created by Kistur asked Little Sky to join the gang so they could use his powers to plunder other dimensions. Little Sky refused and Kistur tried to kill him, but Little Sky fought back and ended up accidentally shooting Kistur's Darkhawk amulet, the focal point of his powers, out of his chest. The loss of the amulet killed Kistur's Darkhawk body, and Little Sky removed and donned Kistur's body armor for further protection. Worried that Kistur might revive, Little Sky attempted to destroy the amulet, but when that failed he discarded it in another   [ 2 ]    Sky eventually managed to return to Earth, opening a portal to a museum in York that and his family were touring.

During this time, Portal was targeted by Shaper a superhuman snuff artist who'd targeted Darkhawk for death. Shaper ended up going after Portal instead when Portal began using Chris Powell's amulet to become the Darkhawk in Chris's place. Meanwhile, members of the Mahari race, another alien species from the same home world as Kistur, took control of the Darkhawk ship in a plan to avenge Kistur. They reanimated Kistur in a redesigned Darkhawk android as Overhawk, and went after Portal's family.

He is not so much evil as amoral mistrustful of others because of his being harassed by those who would exploit his mutant abilities.

His portals allow instantaneous travel between different vibratory-attuned planes of reality, or "dimensions". Opening a portal without preparation will give him access to another dimension completely at seems to possess some talent for finding dimensions he has been to before, yet he could not immediately find Earth again once he first got lost in the dimensional planes. Presumably, then, Portal has a kind of extrasensory "marking" ability, allowing him to record the space/time coordinates of a dimension while he is present in it, so that he could return to it again in the future if he chooses. He could not automatically return to Earth because he had not consciously "marked" it before leaving. Portal is capable of using his powers for teleportation, traveling instantly across about a few miles within a single dimension. Trying to transport himself more than a few miles in one jump, however, will destabilize the portal and send him off into another dimension, even if he is trying to stay anchored in one. Dimensional warps created by Portal cease to exist when he is rendered has also been shown to be able to home in on other people who have gone through one of his portals, opening a new gateway to retrieve or follow them if necessary.
