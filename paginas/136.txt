Plumage Latin  plūma  feather refers both to the layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies, and may vary with age classes, sexes, and season. Within species there can be different colour birds moult usually before and after breeding, resulting in a breeding or and a Many ducks and some other species such as the have males wearing a bright nuptial plumage while breeding and a drab for some months plumages include a variety of conditions. Albinism total loss of colour, is rare, but partial loss of colours is more common. Some species are colour polymorphic having two or more colour variants. A few species have special types of polymorphism, as in the male ruff which has an assortment of different colours around the head and neck in the breeding season  is an inherited plumage character in controlled by a single gene.

Melanism refers to an excess of black or dark colours. Erythromelanism or erythrism is the result of excessive reddish brown erythromelanin deposition in feathers that normally lack melanin. Melanin of different forms combine with xanthophylls to produce colour mixtures and when this combination is imbalanced it produces colour shifts that are termed as schizochroisms (including xanthochromism – overabundance of yellow – and axanthism – lack of yellow – which are commonly bred in cagebirds such as budgerigars A reduction in eumelanin leads to non-eumelanin schizochroism with an overall fawn plumage while a lack of phaeomelanin results in grey coloured non-phaeomelanin schizochroism. Carotenism refers to abnormal distribution of carotenoid term "dilution" is used for situations where the colour is of a lower intensity overall; it is caused by decreased deposition of pigment in the developing feather, and can thus not occur in (i.e., "dilute blue" does not exist); pale structural colors are instead achieved by shifting the peak wavelength at which light is [     ] Dilution regularly occurs in normal plumage (grey, buff, pink and cream colours are usually produced by this process), but may in addition occur as an aberration (e.g., all normally black plumage becoming   [ 9 ]    some birds – many (Strigidae), some nightjars (Caprimulgidae) and a few cuckoos  Cuculus  and relatives) being widely known examples – there is colour polymorphism This means that two or more colour variants are numerous within their populations during all or at least most seasons and plumages; in the above-mentioned examples a brown (phaeomelanin) and grey (eumelanin) morph exist, termed "hepatic form" particularly in the cuckoos. Other cases of natural polymorphism are of various kinds; many are melanic/nonmelanic (some paradise-flycatchers Terpsiphone for example), but more unusual types of polymorphism exist – the face colour of the Erythrura [     ] or the courtship types of male ruffs ). [     ]   Albinism   [  edit  ]    Albinism in birds is rare, occurring to any extent in perhaps one in 1800 individuals. It involves loss of colour in all parts including the iris of the eyes, bills, skin, legs, and feet. It is usually the result of a genetic mutation causing the absence of tyrosinase an enzyme essential for melanin synthesis. Leucism (which includes what used to be termed as "partial albinism") refers to loss of pigments in some or all parts of feathers. A bird that is albino (from the Latin albus "white") has white feathers in place of coloured ones on some portion of its body. A bird that is naturally white, such as a swan goose or egret is not an albino, nor is a bird that has seasonally alternating white   [ 10 ]    degrees of albinism have been described. The most common form is termed in which local areas of the bird's body, such as certain feathers, are lacking the pigment melanin The white areas may be symmetrical, with both sides of the bird showing a similar pattern. In the pigment is partially inhibited in the skin eyes or feathers, but is not absent from any of them. is the complete absence of pigment from the skin, eyes, or feathers, but not all   [ 10 ]          A young completely albino crow in Malacca Malaysia . completely albino bird is the most rare.

Albino adults are rare in the wild because their eyesight is poor resulting in greater risk of   [ 11 ]   They are likely easier targets for predators because their colour distinguishes them from their environment. Falconers have observed that their trained birds are likely to attack a white pigeon in a flock because it is conspicuous. A complete albino often has weak eyesight and brittle wing and tail feathers, which may reduce its ability to fly. In flocks, albinos are often harassed by their own species. Such observations have been made among and In a nesting colony of the latter, three unusual juveniles—one black-headed, one white-headed, and one full albino—were shunned and abused by   [ 10 ]    has been reported in all orders and in 54 families of North American birds.
