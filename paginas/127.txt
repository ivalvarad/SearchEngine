Its digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. An earthworm has a double transport system composed of that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's   [ 2 ]    are hermaphrodites individual carries both male and female sex organs. They lack either an internal skeleton or exoskeleton but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a . is the common name for the largest members of Oligochaeta (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include "dew-worm", "rainworm", "night crawler", and "angleworm" (due to its use as ). terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (or big worms), as opposed to the microdriles (or small worms) in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae Lumbriculidae and Enchytraeidae among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a distinct clitellum (which is more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true are far less abundant in disturbed environments and are typically active only if water is   [ 3 ]     Contents   1 Anatomy    1.1 and     1.2    1.2.1 nervous     1.2.2 nervous     1.2.3 nervous     1.2.4 Working     1.3 Senses    1.3.1 Photosensitivity     1.4     1.5     1.6     1.7 Respiration     1.8 Reproduction     2 Regeneration     3 and importance to     4 Benefits     5 an invasive     6    6.1 Ecology     7     8 and     9     10 References    10.1     11     12    12.1 General     12.2 Academic     12.3 and     12.4     12.5     Anatomy   and  on the species, an adult earthworm can be from 10mm (0.39in) long and 1mm (0.039in) wide to 3m (9.8ft) long and over 25mm (0.98in) wide, but the typical grows to about 360mm (14in)   [ 4 ]    front to back, the basic shape of the earthworm is a cylindrical tube, divided into a series of segments that compartmentalize the body. Grooves called "furrows" are   [ 5 ]   externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephropores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristle-like hairs called lateral setae    [ 6 ]   used to anchor parts of the body during   [ 7 ]   species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per   [ 6 ]   Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their within a species, the number of segments found is consistent across specimens, and individuals are born with the number of segments they will have throughout their lives. The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth and, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the prostomium which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their adult earthworm develops a belt-like glandular swelling, called the clitellum which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The posterior is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened. The last segment is called the periproct the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this   [ 6 ]        exterior of an individual segment is a thin cuticle over skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal   [ 8 ]   Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a coelom    [ 9 ]   that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by transverse dividing walls called "septa" (singular   [ 10 ]   that are perforated, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between   [ 11 ]   A pair of structures called nephrostomes are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment. This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the nephridium or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most   [ 12 ]   At the center of a worm is the which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the ventral nerve cord, and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; Australian (known as the "blue squirter earthworm") can squirt fluid as high as 30cm   [ 11 ]            Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm's nervous system has three parts: the nervous (CNS), nervous and the nervous .   [ 13 ]      [ 14 ]     nervous  CNS consists of a bilobed brain (cerebral ganglia or supra-pharyngeal ganglia), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a ventral nerve brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia. These are located in the dorsal side of the in the third segment, in a groove between the and pharynx . pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. the segmental ganglia, which occur from the fifth to the last segment of the body. There are also three one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord. The MGA is 0.07mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6m/s. The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered as one giant   [ 15 ]      [ 16 ]     nervous  to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the prostomium, buccal chamber and pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th pairs of nerves extend from each segmental ganglia to supply various structures of the  nervous  sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus a web of nerve cells connected together in a two dimensional grid.) The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the circumpharyngeal  Working  the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals. Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer strides and a greater frequency of strides. Larger worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms. They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride   [ 17 ]    an earthworm stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contract, thereby the writhing movements when we pick up an earthworm. This behaviour is a reflex and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexi. The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments. The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the   [ 18 ]    giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord. These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal. If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract. This causes the worm shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear. Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience nociception or pain However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by   [ 19 ]   Enkephalin and α-endorphin substances have been found in earthworms. Injections of nalaxone (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms. This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many   [ 20 ]     Senses   Photosensitivity  do not have eyes (although some worms do), however, they do have specialised photosensitive cells called "light cells of Hess". These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity phaosome filled with microvilli As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory cilia in the phaosome which are structurally independent of the   [ 21 ]   The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm. A relatively small number occur on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third   [ 18 ]      gut of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus. It is differentiated into a buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), esophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and   [ 22 ]    enters the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes pepsin to digest proteins, amylase to digest polysaccharides, cellulase to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest   [ 2 ]   Instead of being coiled like a mammalian intestine, an earthworm's intestine increases surface area to increase nutrient absorption by having many folds running along its length. The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order—an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal   [ 23 ]      earthworm has a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve   [ 24 ]   The dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments six through 11, a pair of aortic arches rings the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and hemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound   [ 25 ]      excretory system contains a pair of nephridia in every segment, except for the first three and the last   [ 26 ]   The three types of nephridia are: integumentary, septal, and pharyngeal. The integumentary nephridia lie attached to the inner side of the body wall in all segments except the first two. The septal nephridia are attached to both sides of the septa behind the 15th segment. The pharyngeal nephridia are attached to fourth, fifth and sixth   [ 26 ]   The waste in the coelom fluid from a forward segment is drawn in by the beating of cilia of the nephrostome From there it is carried through the septum (wall) via a tube which forms a series of loops entwined by blood capillaries that also transfer waste into the tubule of the nephrostome. The excretory wastes are then finally discharged through a pore on the worm's   [ 27 ]     Respiration  have no special respiratory organs. Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the hemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active  Reproduction        Earthworm       Earthworm cocoons from        An earthworm cocoon from  occurs on the surface, most often at night. Earthworms are hermaphrodites that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of testes contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of spermathecae are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation. As a result, segment 15 of one worm exudes sperm into segments 9 and 10 with its storage vesicles of its mate. Some species use external spermatophores for sperm and transcriptome DNA libraries were sequenced and two sex pheromones Attractin and Temptin, were detected in all tissue samples of both species .   [ 28 ]   Sex pheromones are probably important in earthworms because they live in an environment where chemical signaling may play a crucial role in attracting a partner and in facilitating outcrossing. Outcrossing would provide the benefit of masking the expression of deleterious recessive mutations in   [ 29 ]   (Also see complemenation .)  Copulation and reproduction are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends ventrally and each exchanges sperm with the other. The clitellum becomes very reddish to pinkish in color. Some time after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely lemon-shaped incubator cocoon in which the embryonic worms develop. They emerge as small, but fully formed earthworms, but lack their sex structures, which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years. Several common earthworm species are mostly parthenogenetic . lumbricid earthworms, parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives many   [ 30 ]   Parthenogenesis in some lineages arose 6.4 to 1.1 millions of years ago from sexual   [ 31 ]     Regeneration  have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G.E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but “because little interest was shown”, Gates (1972) only published a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species. Despite denial of this phenomenon by some current [   who?   ] Gates’s reports    (Savigny, 1826) with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from   [ 32 ]     Linnaeus 1758 replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never  Perrier, 1872 readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as  Kinberg, 1867 with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from  Sarcophaga  sp. larval  Hoffmeister, 1845 also has prodigious regenerative capacity with ‘head’ regeneration from as far back as   [ 33 ]    unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been   [ 34 ]     and importance to        Close up of an earthworm in garden travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body peristalsis The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny claw-like bristles setae set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. Worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed as a result of the their movement through their lubricated tunnels. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body   [ 35 ]    work as biological pistons forcing air through the tunnels as they move. Thus earthworm activity aerates and mixes the soil, and is conducive to mineralization of nutrients and their uptake by vegetation. Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with soil fertility, an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by the . [     ] In fact, as long ago as 1881 wrote: "It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized   [ 36 ]     Benefits  major benefits of earthworm activities to soil fertility can be summarized  Biological In many soils, earthworms play a major role in the conversion of large pieces of organic matter into rich humus thus improving soil fertility. This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface, deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf and partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see below) can contain 40% more humus than the top 9" (23cm) of soil in which the worm is   [ 3 ]          Faeces in form of  Chemical In addition to dead the earthworm also ingests any other soil particles that are small enough—including sand grains up to 1/20 of an inch (1.25mm)—into its gizzard, wherein those minute fragments of grit grind everything into a fine paste which is then digested in the intestine. When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available nitrogen seven times richer in available phosphates and 11 times richer in available potassium than the surrounding upper 6inches (150mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5kg (10lb) per worm per   [ 3 ]     Physical The earthworm's burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the enabling processes of aeration and drainage. Permaculture co-founder points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms "act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at   [ 37 ]   Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see Bioturbation Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil (mucus)) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and   [ 3 ]    accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through fragmentation  mixing of plant debris – physical grinding  chemical   [ 3 ]   The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted.
