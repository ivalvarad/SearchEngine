This began with a qualitative environment survey on MediaWiki extensions, followed by a Qualitative Statistical Survey focusing on volume of edits, number of new users, and related statistics. In March 2009, a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non-editors of the English Wikipedia. The aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing Wikipedia, ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates. The study recruited 2500 people for in-person laboratory testing via the Wikipedia website, which was filtered down to ten participants. The results were collated and used by the technology team to improve Wikipedia's   [ 31 ]   The Usability and Experience Study was followed up by the Usability, Experience and Progress Study in September 2009.

Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Daniel Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene   [ 44 ]      [ 45 ]   was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching.
