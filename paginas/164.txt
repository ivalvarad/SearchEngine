After days and nights of hard fighting and killing some 800Japanese, the 19th and Infantry expanded their beachhead and took control of the high ground commanding the entrance to the northern Leyte Valley. By 1November, after a seven-day tank-infantry advance supported by artillery fire, both regiments had pushed through Leyte Valley and were within sight of the north coast and the port of Carigara which the 2nd Cavalry Brigade occupied the next day after Suzuki ordered a   [ 1 ]    :99–106 In its drive through Leyte Valley, the 24thDivision inflicted nearly 3,000enemy casualties .

Hodge had sent his two divisions into the southern Leyte Valley, which already contained four airfields and a large supply center. Maj.Gen. James L. Bradley's Infantry was to clear CatmonHill, a 1,400ft (430m) promontory, the highest point in both corps beachheads, and used by the Japanese as an observation and firing post to fire on approaching the beach on A-day. Under cover of incessant artillery and naval gunfire, Bradley's troops made their way through the swamps south and west of the high ground at LabirananHead. After a three-day fight, the 382nd Infantry Regiment took a key Japanese supply base at Tabontabon 5mi (8.0km) inland, and killed some 350Japanese on 28October. Simultaneously two battalions each from the 381st Infantry Regiment and 383rd Infantry Regiments slowly advanced up opposite sides of Catmon Hill and battled the fierce Japanese resistance. When the mop-up of Catmon Hill was completed on 31October, the Americans had cleared 53 pillboxes 17 caves, and several heavy artillery   [ 1 ]    :65–69        US armored car at Labiranan the left of XXIV Corps, the 7th Infantry Division under Maj.

While two battalions of the 184thInfantry patrolled the corps' left flank, the 17thInfantry, with the 184th's 2ndBattalion attached, turned north toward Dagami 6mi (9.7km) above Burauen. Using flamethrowers to root the enemy out of pillboxes and a cemetery, US troops captured Dagami on 30October, which forced Gen.Makino to evacuate his command post further   [ 1 ]    :95–96 Meanwhile, on 29October, the 32ndInfantry's 2ndBattalion, preceded by the 7thCavalry Reconnaissance Troop, moved 15mi (24km) south along the east coast to Abuyog for a probe of the area, and then over the next four days patrolled west through the mountains to Baybay all without   [ 1 ]    :96     [  edit  ]   432,000 Japanese soldiers in the Philippines, General Yamashita decided to make Leyte the main effort of the Japanese defense, and on 21 October, ordered the to coordinate a decisive battle with the Imperial Japanese   [ 1 ]    :64,73 The 16th Division was to be reinforced by the 30th Infantry Division from Mindanao, landing on Ormoc   [ 1 ]    :64 The 102nd Infantry Division would occupy Jaro, where the 1st and 26th Infantry Divisions were   [ 1 ]    :64 Battalions from the 55th and 57th Independent Mixed Brigades were on Leyte by 25   [ 1 ]    :73  the Sixth Army pushed deeper into Leyte, the Japanese struck back in the air and at sea. On 24October, some 200 enemy aircraft approached American beachheads and shipping from the   [ 1 ]    :70 Fifty American land-based aircraft rose to intercept them, and claimed to have shot down between   [ 1 ]    :70 and 84 of the attackers. Day and night air raids continued over the next four   [ 1 ]    :71 damaging supply dumps ashore and threatening American shipping. But by 28October, counterattacks by US aircraft on Japanese airfields and shipping on other islands so reduced enemy air strength that conventional air raids ceased to be a major threat. As their air strength diminished, the Japanese resorted to the deadly kamikazes ,   [ 1 ]    :71 a corps of suicide pilots who crashed their bomb-laden planes directly into USships. They chose the large American transport and escort fleet that had gathered in LeyteGulf on A-day as their first target and sank one escort carrier and badly damaged many other       Four Japanese snipers shot and killed in the muddy water of a bomb more serious danger to the US forces developed at sea. The Imperial Japanese Navy's high command decided to destroy US Navy forces supporting the Sixth Army by committing its entire remaining surface fleet to a decisive battle with the Americans. The Imperial Navy's plan was to attack in three major task groups. One, which included four with few aircraft aboard, was to act as a decoy, luring the US 3rdFleet north away from Leyte Gulf. If the decoy was successful, the other two groups, consisting primarily of heavy surface combatants, would enter the gulf from the west and attack the American       A US anti-aircraft gun at Tacloban airfield in 23 October, the approach of the enemy surface vessels was detected. US naval units moved out to intercept, and the air and naval of Leyte largest naval battle in the   [ 1 ]    :70 and also one of the naval battles in    [ 10 ]   fought from 23-26October—the Japanese suffered a decisive defeat. Nonetheless by 11December, the Japanese had succeeded in moving more than 34,000troops to Leyte and over 10,000 t of materiél, most through the port of Ormoc on the west coast, despite heavy losses to reinforcement convoys, including engagements at because of relentless air interdiction missions by US  Towards the Ormoc   [  edit  ]   Japanese reinforcement presented severe problems for both Krueger and   [ 1 ]    :107 Instead of projected mopping up operations after clearing the east side of Leyte, the Sixth Army had to prepare for extended combat in the mountains on its western   [ 1 ]    :110 which included landing three reserve divisions on Leyte, this pushed MacArthur's operations schedule for the Philippine campaign back and the War Department's deployment plans in the Krueger planned a giant to clear Ormoc Valley, with XCorps forces moving south, and XXIVCorps units pushing north from   [ 1 ]    :111 To overcome the expected increased resistance, especially in the mountain barrier to the north, Krueger mobilized his reserve forces, the 32nd and 77th Infantry Divisions, while MacArthur activated the Airborne The 21stRCT pulled out from the Panaon area to rejoin the 24thDivision and were replaced by a battalion of the 32ndInfantry. On 3November, the 34thInfantry Regiment moved out from west of Carigara to sweep the rest of the northern coast before turning south into the mountains. The 1stBattalion soon came under attack from a ridge along the highway. Supported by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion, the unit cleared the ridge, and the 34thInfantry continued unopposed that night through the town of Pinamopoan, recovering numerous heavy weapons abandoned by the enemy, then halted at the point where Highway2 turns south into the   [ 1 ]    :111–113   of Breakneck Ridge, Battle of Kilay   [  edit  ]   7 November the 21st Infantry went into its first sustained combat on Leyte when it moved into the mountains along Highway2, near Carigara   [ 1 ]    :115 The fresh regiment, with the 19thInfantry's 3rdBattalion attached, immediately ran into strong defenses of the newly arrived Japanese aligned from east to west across the road and anchored on a network of fighting positions built of heavy logs and interconnecting trench lines and countless spider holes, which became known as "Breakneck Ridge" to the Americans, or the "Yamashita Line" to the   [ 1 ]    :116 General Krueger ordered the 1st Cavalry to join the 24th Infantry Division in the attack south, and the X and XXIV Corps (96th Infantry Division) to block routes through the central mountain range, anticipating General Suzuki's renewed attack with the arrival of his 26th Infantry   [ 1 ]    :120–121 Additionally the XXIV Corps had the 7th Infantry Division in   [ 1 ]    :121 Plus, Krueger had access to the 32nd and Infantry and the Airborne which MacArthur was staging in Leyte in preparation of the Luzon   [ 1 ]    :133  typhoon began on 8 November, and the heavy rain that followed for several days further impeded American   [ 1 ]    :116 Despite the storm and high winds, which added falling trees and mud slides to enemy defenses and delayed supply trains, the 21stInfantry continued its slow and halting attack, with companies often having to withdraw and recapture hills that had been taken earlier. The Americans seized the approaches to Hill1525 2mi (3.2km) to the east, enabling Irving to stretch out the enemy defenses further across a 4mi (6.4km) front along Highway2. After five days of battling against seemingly impregnable hill positions and two nights of repulsing enemy counterattacks proved fruitless, Irving decided on a double envelopment of the enemy the east, the 19thInfantry's 2ndBattalion, under Lt. Col. Robert B. Spragins, swung east around Hill1525 behind the enemy right flank, cutting back to Highway2, 3mi (4.8km) south of 'Breakneck Ridge', blocking the Japanese supply   [ 1 ]    :133–140 On the west, Irving sent the 34thInfantry's 1stBattalion under Lt.Col. Thomas E. Clifford, over water from the Carigara area to a point 2mi (3.2km) west of the southward turn of Highway2, and moved it inland. This amphibious maneuver was made in eighteen LVTs of the 727th Amphibian Tractor   [ 11 ]   After crossing a ridge line and the Leyte River, they approached the enemy left flank at 900ft (270m) on Kilay Ridge, the highest terrain behind the main battle   [ 1 ]    :147 Both battalions reached positions only about 1,000yd (910m) apart on opposite sides of the highway by 13November despite strong opposition and heavy rains. The Americans were aided by the 1st Battalion, 96th Philippine Infantry, a local guide who "owned" Kilay Ridge, and Filipinos carrying   [ 1 ]    :148–149        Filipino volunteers carry supplies to the 12th Cavalry took Clifford's men two weeks of struggle through mud and rain—often dangerously close to friendly mortar and artillery fire—to root the Japanese out of fighting positions on the way up Kilay Ridge. On 2December Clifford's battalion finally cleared the heights overlooking the road, and 32ndDivision units quickly took over. Clifford's outfit suffered 26killed, 101wounded and two missing, in contrast to 900Japanese   [ 1 ]    :162 For their arduous efforts against Kilay Ridge and adjacent areas, both flanking battalions received Unit .

Mountainous terrain and impassable roads forced Sixth Army transportation units to improvise resupply trains of Navy landing craft, tracked landing vehicles, airdrops, artillery tractors, trucks, even carabaos and hundreds of barefoot Filipino bearers. The 727th Amphibian Tractor Battalion made daily, often multiple, trips with ammunition and rations between Capoocan and Calubian From Calubian, the 727th tractors would navigate the Naga River to Consuegra and then traverse overland to Agahang. On their return trip, they would evacuate the casualties. Not surprisingly, the complex scheduling slowed resupply as well as the pace of assaults, particularly in the mountains north and east of Ormoc Valley and subsequently in the ridgelines along  of Shoestring   [  edit  ]   the naval battle, see of Ormoc . mid-November XXIVCorps had the Infantry under the command of Lt.

The 7thDivision pushed north with two regiments which encountered heavy enemy fire coming from Hill918, from which the entire coast to Ormoc City could be observed. By 8 Dec., the American forces had taken Hills 918, 380 and 606, plus the surrounding   [ 1 ]    :200–205 By 12December, Gen.Arnold's lead battalion was less than 10mi (16km) south of Ormoc  of the   [  edit  ]   Gen.

In between at Cogan, the last enemy salient with its defenses anchored on a concrete blockhouse, north of Ormoc, and held by the 12thIndependent Infantry Regiment, resisted the Americans for two   [ 1 ]    :257 On 14December, the 305thInfantry closed on the stronghold, aided by heavy artillery barrages and employing flamethrowers and armored bulldozers. Hand-to-hand combat and the inspiring leadership of of awardee Captain B. cleared the enemy from the blockhouse area, while the leading Company, E, of the 2ndBattalion, 305thInfantry moved forward through intense fire and killed several Japanese   [ 1 ]    :258   march to the   [  edit  ]   breaking out of Ormoc, the 77th Division took Valencia airfield, 7mi (11km) north, on 18December, and continued north to establish contact with XCorps   [ 1 ]    :274 That same day, Gen.Sibert ordered the 1stCavalry Division to complete the drive south. The Cavalry pushed out of the mountains on a southwest track to Highway2, then followed fire from the 271st Field Artillery Battalion to clear a 3mi (4.8km) stretch of the road. North of Ormoc Valley, the 32ndDivision had met determined opposition from the defending Japanese 1stDivision along Highway2, after moving south past Kilay Ridge and entering a heavy rain forest, which limited visibility and concealed the enemy. Using flamethrowers, hand grenades rifles, and bayonets, troops scratched out daily advances measured in yards, and in five days of hard fighting, the 126th and Infantry advanced less than 1mi (1.6km). Contact between patrols of the 12thCavalry and the 77thDivision's 306thInfantry on 21December marked the juncture of the US X and XXIVCorps and the closing of the SixthArmy's pincer maneuver against Ormoc   [ 1 ]    :284  the 77th and 32nd Divisions converged on the valley, Maj.Gen. M. 11thAirborne Division had moved into the central mountain passes from the east. With blocking positions established south of Leyte Valley on 22–24November, the Parachute Infantry pushed farther west into the mountains on the 25November. After an arduous advance, the 511th reached Mahonag, 10mi (16km) west of Burauen, on 6December, the same day Japanese paratroops landed at the Buri and SanPablo airfields. On 16December, the 2ndBattalion, 32ndInfantry, made slow but steady progress into the mountains from the OrmocBay area to meet the airborne regiment and assist its passage westward. On 23December, after battling scattered Japanese defenders on ridges and in caves, the 7thDivision infantrymen met troops from the 2ndBattalion, Glider Infantry which had passed through the 511th, to complete the cross-island move, and basically destroying the Japanese 26th Infantry Division in the   [ 1 ]    :258–264  Bruce opened the drive on Palompon by sending the 2nd and 3rdBattalions, 305thInfantry, with armor support, west along the road on the morning of   [ 1 ]    :289 The 302ndEngineer Battalion followed, repairing and strengthening bridges for armor, artillery and supply vehicles. Assault units progressed rapidly through sporadic enemy fire until they hit strong positions about 8mi (13km) short of Palompon. To restore momentum, Gen.Bruce put the 1stBattalion, 305thInfantry, on Navy landing craft and dispatched it from the port of Ormoc to Palompon. Supported by fire from mortar boats of the 2ndEngineer Special Brigade and from the 155mm (6.1in) guns of the 531st Field Artillery Battalion, the infantrymen landed at 07:20 on 25December and secured the small coastal town within four   [ 1 ]    :290  of the seizure of the last port open to the Japanese, Gen. MacArthur announced the end of organized resistance on   [ 1 ]    :290 As these sweeps continued, he transferred control of operations on Leyte and Samar to the Eighth Army on 26December. Farther north, other US forces made faster progress against more disorganized and dispirited enemy troops. 1stCavalry Division troops reached the coast on   [ 1 ]    :295 as 24thDivision units cleared the last enemy positions from the northwest corner of Leyte on the same day and two days later met patrols of the 32ndDivision. But Japanese defenders continued to fight as units until 31December, and the ensuing mop-up of stragglers continued until 8May  Aftermath   [  edit  ]   campaign for Leyte proved the first and most decisive operation in the American reconquest of the Philippines. Japanese losses in the campaign were heavy, with the army losing four divisions and several separate combat units, while the navy lost 26 major warships and 46 large transports and hundreds of merchantmen. The struggle also reduced Japanese land-based air capability in the Philippines by more than 50%. Some 250,000 troops still remained on Luzon but the loss of air and naval support at Leyte so narrowed Gen.Yamashita's options that he now had to fight a passive defensive of   [ 1 ]    :325 the largest and most important island in the Philippines. In effect, once the decisive battle of Leyte was lost, the Japanese gave up hope of retaining the Philippines, conceding to the Allies a critical bastion from which Japan could be easily cut off from outside resources, and from which the final assaults on the Japanese home islands could be       by at Landing Memorial National on Leyte    [  edit  ]    David   B.
