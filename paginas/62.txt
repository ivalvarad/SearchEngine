In this instance, the president neither signs nor vetoes the legislation.

These agreements frequently regard administrative policy choices germane to executive power; for example, the extent to which either country presents an armed presence in a given area, how each country will enforce copyright treaties, or how each country will process foreign mail. However, the 20th century witnessed a vast expansion of the use of executive agreements, and critics have challenged the extent of that use as supplanting the treaty process and removing constitutionally prescribed checks and balances over the executive in foreign relations. Supporters counter that the agreements offer a pragmatic solution when the need for swift, secret, and/or concerted action [     ]    it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome    v.

The first is which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the the Supreme Court ruled in  States v.  418 U.S. 683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President attempted to use executive privilege regarding the the Supreme Court ruled in  v.  520 U.S. 681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the   [ 37 ]          President W. delivering the State of the Union with and of the behind secrets allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security.

However, the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the president's political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress. For example, the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today are given as the of the Union which often outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong to Congress.
