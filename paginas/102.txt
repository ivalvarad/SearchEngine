By determining which polygons are currently not visible, and not rendering those objects, significant performance improvements can be portal system is based on using the partitioning of space to form generalizations about the visibility of objects within those spaces. Regions of map space are divided into polygonal, generally convex, areas called zones or sometimes sectors Adjacent zones are linked to one another via shared dividing polygons termed portals Approaches that precompute visibility for zones are referred to as visible or PVS example, in a such as  Descent  the game area might be divided into several zones. These zones would then be connected to each other by small openings such as doors or windows. These openings are referred to as portals When the zone behind a portal needs to be drawn, the only parts that are visible are the parts that can be seen through the portal. Therefore, the zone can be clipped against the portal boundaries to remove use of portals simplifies the task of determining visible areas and objects from any given point of view of the level, and simplifies rendering by allowing it to use each portal as a for the area it leads to. Ideally, portals are formed of confined areas (like doors or tunnels), connecting two complex areas of the scene, where each of these areas would be enclosed in such a polygonal are best suited for indoor scenes such as mazes. Outdoor scenes do not usually have door-like objects that would clearly separate one zone from    [  edit  ]    Antiportal     [  edit  ]    a 3D Portal       article is a stub You can help Wikipedia by .   v     t     e          					 						Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal_renderingoldid=572034891 "					   Categories      graphics     categories:   stub     				        						 Namespaces   Article     Talk   Variants    Views   Read     Edit        More     Search     							    Navigation      Contents             to     					 Interaction   Help              					 Tools   links                      this  					 Print/export   a    as     					 Languages   Deutsch    Suomi      					     			 This page was last modified on 8 September 2013, at is available under the Commons Attribution-ShareAlike   additional terms may apply.
