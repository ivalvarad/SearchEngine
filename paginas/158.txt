These were carried in three silos fitted in the rear of the large sail behind the bridge. They could only be fired with the submarine surfaced and the missile raised above the sail but the submarine could be underway at the time. Only the first three boats were equipped with these—the remaining ones were equipped with the longer range R-13 first boats were commissioned in 1958 and the last in boats were built at two shipyards — 16 in Severodvinsk and 7 in Komsomolsk-na-Amure in the Far East. Fourteen were extensively modified in 1966–1972 and became known as 629A's by the and Golf IIs by NATO (the original version having been designated Golf I). The major change was the upgrade of the missile system to carry R-21 missiles which could be launched from inside their tubes with the submarine submerged and increased speed. In later years a few were converted to test new missiles and others had different boats had left Soviet service by 1990. In 1993, ten were sold to for   [ 5 ]   According to some sources, the North Koreans are attempting to get these boats back into   [ 6 ]    1959 the project technology was sold to China which built a single modified example in 1966, which is still in       Several views of a Project 629A (Golf II) ballistic missile    [  edit  ]   article:  March 8, 1968, 1,560 nautical miles (2,890km) northwest of Oahu in the the Golf II class submarine K-129 exceeded its crush depth for unknown reasons and imploded, the accident being registered by the SOSUS network. The entire crew of 98 was lost and the vessel sank with three ballistic nuclear missiles as well as two nuclear torpedoes. The recovered parts of the submarine in July 1974 from a depth of around 5km, in an operation named .   [ 7 ]    nuclear submarines that had been facing retirement, USS Halibut (SSGN-587) and USS Seawolf (SSN-575) were rebuilt and pressed into service as deep sea search vehicles. After Halibut discovered a sunken Soviet submarine containing at least one intact ballistic missile complete with nuclear warhead, States Secretary of under President approved Azorian. Six years later, 350 nautical miles (648km) north of the Hawaiian a mechanical claw descended 17,000 feet (5,200m) to the bottom of the Pacific and, guided by computers on board the clamped onto the mass of twisted, rusting steel and began slowly raising it to the surface. It is unknown for sure how successful the effort was, but the United States has admitted to recovering a portion of K-129, which included six bodies of Soviet sailors that were buried at sea with full   [ 8 ]     Variants   [  edit  ]    Original design received reporting with a total of 22 boats built between 1958 through 1962. Dimension are 98.4 m for length, 8.2 m for beam and 7.85 m for draft. Surfaced/submerged displacement are 2794 / 3553 tons respectively. Surfaced/submerged speed are 15 / 12.5 kn respectively. Project 629 is crewed by 80 men, and is equipped by either D-1 launching system for SS-N-1 or D-2 launching systems for SS-N-4 SLBMs .   [ 9 ]     K-229 was converted in 1958 in Severodvinsk under Project 629B to test newly designed on board missile control system, which was the first generation design fully based on   [ 10 ]     14 Project 629/Golf I class submarines were converted to Project 629A between 1966 thru 1972, and received NATO reporting name Changes include the increase of dimension, with length and draft increased to 98.9 / 8.5 m respectively, the surfaced/submerged displaced increased to 2300-2820 / 2700-3553 t respectively, surfaced/submerged speed increased to 17 / 14 kn respectively. Crew is increased to 83, and the launching system is D-4 for SS-N-5   [ 9 ]     K-118 was converted from 1969 thru 1974 and received NATO reporting name with displacement increased to 4000 tons and number of SLBMs increased to 6, and the missile is SS-N-8 .   [ 9 ]     K-102 was converted from 1969 thru 1973 and received NATO reporting name lengthened 18.3 m with 4 SLBMs to test   [ 9 ]     K-153 was converted in 1976 to test SS-N-20 SLBM, and received NATO reporting name .   [ 9 ]     "K-61", "B-42" and "K-107" were converted in Vladivostok into command posts between 1973 - 1979, with the missile and torpedo tubes removed, received NATO reporting name .   [ 9 ]     Chinese built Golf-class submarine built in Dalian between 1960 thru 1966, after receiving technical data from USSR in 1959. China did not purchase SLBM, and thus Type 6631 was equipped with simulation systems and mainly used for training. Originally with 1101, it was subsequently changed to 200 in 1967. The second unit was supposed to be built and delivered by USSR (pennant number K-208), but due to most on board equipment was not delivered, and the boat was used as sample for reverse engineering to complete the first unit, which entered Chinese service in August 1966. In June 1968, Type 6631 went through a major refit because China decided to adopt solid fueled SLBM instead of liquid fueled SLBM Soviet used, so the simulation equipment was replaced by support equipments of solid fueled SLBM. In addition, the planned Chinese SLBM had different dimension than the original Russian SLBM equipped Golf class submarine, so the number of missile tubes were reduced to two from the original   [ 11 ]     Type 6631 went through a second major refit which was completed in November 1978. The most important improvement is the ability to launch SLBM underwater. In addition to changing to Type 031 from the original Type 6631, the unit also received the name when China begun to restored the practice to name its warships in the 1980s. The unit is hence usually referred as Great Wall   [ 12 ]     References   [  edit  ]      ^      Retrieved .          ^     "629"  Retrieved .          ^     "629"  Retrieved .          ^    http://www.strategycenter.net/research/pubID.3/pub_detail.asp      ^     - Chronology of North Korea's Missile Trade and Developments:  Retrieved .          ^     Korea's Brand New Ballistic Sub Discontinued by Soviets in Retrieved 2014-11-04  .          ^     Azorian: The Story of the Hughes Glomar (PDF) Studies in Intelligence, CIA Fall Retrieved 2010-02-13  .          ^    Later Details Emerge About CIA Hunt for Soviet       a       b       c       d       e       f       Golf class  Retrieved 2000-09-26  .     date values in: |access-date= help )      ^     missile submarines - Project  Retrieved .          ^     "6631型G级常规动力弹道导弹潜艇_舰船档案_新浪博客"  Retrieved .          ^    031      [  edit  ]    submarine details on FAS   Golf I/II submarines - Complete Ship List    v     t     e    Golf-classsubmarines     K-36 ⁄ B-106     K-61 ⁄ BS-167     B-40 ⁄ K-72 ⁄ K-372     K-75 ⁄ B-575     B-41 ⁄ K-79 ⁄ B-79     B-42 ⁄ K-83 ⁄ BS-83     K-88 ⁄ B-183     K-91 ⁄ B-91     K-93 ⁄ B-93     B-92 ⁄ K-96 ⁄ BS-167     K-99     B-121 ⁄ K-102     K-125 ⁄ B-107 ⁄ BS-107     K-110 ⁄ B-110     K-113     K-118     B-93 ⁄ K-126     K-129     K-136     K-139     K-142     K-153 ⁄ BS-153     K-163     of Soviet and Russian   of Soviet and Russian submarine    v     t     e    Soviet and Russian submarines after  missile nuclear submarines – SSBN       Delta   Delta   Delta     Delta     missile nuclear submarines – SSGN   Echo   Echo   Charlie   Charlie     S    Oscar   Oscar   attack submarines – SSN     Victor   Victor   Victor     Sierra   Sierra     S        ballistic missile submarines – SSB   Zulu     cruise missile submarines – SSG   Whiskey     attack submarines – SS or SSK           S            Improved     Kalina   submarines – SSA         S      S         Sarov    S    S ship of        					 						Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golf-class_submarineoldid=686695584 "					   Categories      and Soviet navy submarine        categories:   errors:     				        						 Namespaces   Article     Talk   Variants    Views   Read     Edit        More     Search     							    Navigation      Contents             to     					 Interaction   Help              					 Tools   links                      this  					 Print/export   a    as     					 Languages   Български    Čeština    Deutsch    Español    فارسی    한국어    Italiano    日本語    Polski    Русский    Suomi    Svenska    Українська       中文      					     			 This page was last modified on 20 October 2015, at is available under the Commons Attribution-ShareAlike   additional terms may apply.
