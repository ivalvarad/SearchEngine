Yard graduated from and spent the first twenty years of his career as a journalist, editor and publisher. In 1915 he was recruited by his friend to help publicize the need for an independent national park agency. Their numerous publications were part of a movement that resulted in legislative support for a Park in 1916. Yard served as head of the National Parks Educational Committee for several years after its conception, but tension within the NPS led him to concentrate on non-government initiatives. He became executive secretary of the Parks in 1919. Yard worked to promote the national parks as well as educate Americans about their use. Creating high standards based on aesthetic ideals for park selection, he also opposed commercialism and industrialization of what he called "America's masterpieces". These standards caused discord with his peers. After helping to establish a relationship between the NPA and the States Forest Yard later became involved in the protection of wilderness areas. In 1935 he became one of the eight founding members of Wilderness and acted as its first president from 1937 until his death eight years later. Yard is now considered an important figure in the modern wilderness movement.   ...Archive/Nominations     More...      edit         28, – State of the Union Address by President George W.     your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported You can the or a to play the clip in your  W.
