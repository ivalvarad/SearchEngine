That said, however, I make no mistake in saying that the death metal peddled by Australia’s Portal is truly friggin'   [ 1 ]   Lead guitarist Horror Illogium has described Portal's intent as "to capture a cinematic horror   [ 2 ]     Contents   1     2     3 themes and musical     4 Members    4.1 Current     4.2 Former     5 Discography    5.1     5.2     5.3     6 References     7       [  edit  ]   main musical influences were Beherit and Immolation .

Denise Falzon, writing for Exclaim! described Portal's 2004 EP, as "extremely raw [...] with heavily distorted guitar riffs that aid in the album's overall chaotic and apocalyptic   [ 6 ]   The band's style has also been described as oriented around "constant dissonance", "sporadic compositions", and "abstract   [ 7 ]   However, lead guitarist Horror Illogium has disputed the view that the band's songwriting lacks structure: "We are indeed making songs, although our structures are unusual. They are constructed with a great deal of artistic, obsessive scrutiny [...] An insane asylum is a structure; our songs can be viewed as structures housing insane   [ 8 ]    if Portal's exploration of extreme music could eventually move beyond the scope of death metal, Horror Illogium responded explores depth and atmosphere in the aim of a descriptive soundscape. The term "extreme" would not really apply to us in the context that other bands would use: the fastest blastbeat or the most technical guitar work. That kind of mindframe as though it is a sport is sickening! Extreme for the sake of extreme in any regard has no place in our art. The feeling must flow, exploring different planes of darkness and atmosphere. There is no interest in taking the main core of Portal beyond Metal at all. In fact, we don't feel as though this form of Death Metal has reached its greatest potential   [ 8 ]    some critics have noted a "lack of production quality" and "unrefined, murky sound" on Portal's   [ 6 ]   Horror Illogium countered that the band spends considerable time consciously "exploring different equipment for guitar tones with enough articulation as well as   [ 8 ]   Stating that "there are only so many frequencies that can share a space," he indicated that Portal's approach involved striking "a balance to allow the instruments to spill forth and explode when necessary.

[ 9 ]   According to a recent interview, however, their lore is deeply set in other writings. Guitarist Horror Illogium stated that Lovecraft was barely more than a mentioning in their early days, and they have since developed their own mythos.
