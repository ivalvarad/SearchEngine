This species has elliptic green leaves and large, bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes, appearing in summer and autumn.

Eubanksia was demoted to sectional rank, and divided it into four series. B.verticillata was placed in series  Salicinae  because its leaves are more or less linear, and have white   [ 21 ]   Based as they were on leaf characters, Meissner's series were highly   [ 15 ]   and discarded them all in 1870 revision of Banksia  B.verticillata was instead placed in a new section,  Oncostylis  because of its hooked   [ 22 ]   This arrangement would stand for over a many years there was confusion between B.verticillata and  B.littoralis  (Swamp Banksia). Until 1984, the latter was circumscribed as encompassing what is now   (River Banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata Thus it was easy to perceive B.verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon .

With respect to B.verticillata their findings largely accorded with George's arrangement: section Oncostylis was discarded as polyphyletic but series Spicigerae was inferred to be monophyletic, and B.verticillata appeared in a succession of clades with the species previously identified as its closest relatives: first B.littoralis then B.seminuda then B.brownii and finally  B.occidentalis  (Red Swamp   [ 24 ]          B.occidentalis           B.brownii           B.seminuda           B.littoralis         B.verticillata             clade became the basis of Thiele and Ladiges'  B.

A after a mild fire in National published in 1994 found that plants burnt by fire were ten times as likely to have seedlings come up under their crown as unburnt plants (with an average of 25.2 seedlings per burnt plant), and burnt spikes released double the number of seeds as unburnt spikes. Despite this, interfire recruitment (seedlings arising between fires) has also been recorded, and might be more common than in other Banksia species. Observations at several of the populations showed many plants produced their first seed anywhere from 13 to 17 years of age, leading to a recommendation of 20 years between fires to allow seed banks to   [ 2 ]   If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed   [ 28 ]     Conservation   [  edit  ]    has been declared Vulnerable under the federal  Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  ,   [ 1 ]   and Rare under Western Australia's  Conservation Act  .
