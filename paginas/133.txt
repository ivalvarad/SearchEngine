Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70cm (22–28in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants . insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming (see below, Locomotion As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, such as are capable of walking on the surface of water. Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees ants and termites are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, such as earwigs show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. Lampyridae in the order communicate with regard certain insects as pests and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits A few parasitic species are pathogenic Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases. lnsect pollinators are essential to the life-cycle of many species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere (including humans) would be   [ 8 ]   Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.

In 2008, researchers at uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300 million-year-old specimen from the .   [ 15 ]   The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian   from the 396-million-year-old It may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian   [ 1 ]      [ 16 ]    have been four super radiations of insects: beetles (evolved ~300 million years ago), flies (evolved ~250 million years ago), moths and wasps (evolved ~150 million years   [ 17 ]   These four groups account for the majority of described species. The flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the Mecoptera . origins of remain obscure, since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, there is no evidence that suggests that the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have   [ 18 ]     and Early Permian insect orders include both extant groups, their stem   [ 19 ]   and a number of Paleozoic groups, now extinct. During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70cm (22 to 28in) making them far larger than any living insect. This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian period that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the extinction the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years   [ 20 ]    remarkably successful Hymenopterans appeared as long as 146 million years ago in the Cretaceous period, but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the Cenozoic era, which began 66 million years ago. A number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with a powerful illustration of   [ 21 ]    modern insect genera developed during the Cenozoic. Insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber often in perfect condition. The body plan, or  morphology  of such specimens is thus easily compared with modern species. The study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology .    [  edit  ]   are prey for a variety of organisms, including terrestrial vertebrates.

Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning   [ 23 ]   This successful evolutionary pattern has also been utilized by mimics Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination are beneficial to both organisms.

Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that Hexapoda is polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from   [ 26 ]   Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass superorder and infraorder it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group). The following represents the best supported monophyletic groupings for the can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish (Thysanura). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. It is possible that the Thysanura themselves are not monophyletic with the family Lepidotrichidae being a to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining   [ 27 ]      [ 28 ]    and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites also, in Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, Paraneoptera has turned out to be more closely related to Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea .   [ 29 ]   Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form   [ 30 ]   Mantodea, Blattodea and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera .   [ 31 ]    is likely that Exopterygota is paraphyletic in regard to Endopterygota. Matters that have had a lot of controversy include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological   [ 32 ]   The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid   [ 33 ]   Many questions remain to be answered when it comes to basal relationships amongst endopterygote orders, particularly study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called If one works with a more specific order or even a family, the term may also be made specific to that order or family, for example .  and   [  edit  ]   article:  the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain, estimates range from 2.6–7.8 million species with a mean of 5.5   [ 34 ]   This probably represents less than 20% of all species on [     ] and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms being described each year, most species likely will remain undescribed for many years unless species descriptions increase in rate. About 850,000–1,000,000 of all described species are insects. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 3 million species included in Coleoptera Diptera Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera A recent study estimated the number of beetles at 0.9–2.1 million with a mean of 1.5   [ 34 ]    of the estimated number of species in the four most speciose insect [     ]   description (species per Coleoptera 300,000–400,000 2308 0.01 Lepidoptera 110,000–120,000 642 0.03 Diptera 90,000–150,000 1048 0.04 Hymenoptera 100,000–125,000 1196 0.02  and   [  edit  ]   articles: and   External   [  edit  ]         Insect A Head B Thorax C antenna  2. ocelli 3. ocelli 4.  5. brain (cerebral ganglia ) 6. prothorax  7. dorsal blood 8. tracheal tubes (trunk with spiracle ) 9. mesothorax  10. metathorax  11. forewing  12. hindwing  13. mid-gut 14. dorsal tube 15. 16. hind-gut (intestine, rectum  17. 18. 19. nerve chord (abdominal 20.  21. tarsal 22. 23. tarsus  24. tibia  25. femur  26. trochanter  27. fore-gut (crop, 28. thoracic 29. coxa  30. salivary 31.  32. mouthparts  have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata a head, a thorax and an abdomen .

Of all the insect orders, Orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects, including the sutures and sclerites .   [ 36 ]   Here, the vertex or the apex (dorsal region), is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head. In prognathous insects, the vertex is not found between the compound eyes, but rather, where the ocelli are normally. This is because the primary axis of the head is rotated 90° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body. In some species, this region is modified and assumes a different   [ 36 ]    :13  thorax is a tagma composed of three sections, the prothorax mesothorax and the metathorax The anterior segment, closest to the head, is the prothorax, with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum. The middle segment is the mesothorax, with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings. The third and most posterior segment, abutting the abdomen, is the metathorax, which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings. Each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture. Each segment has four basic regions. The dorsal surface is called the tergum (or notum to distinguish it from the abdominal   [ 25 ]   The two lateral regions are called the pleura (singular: pleuron) and the ventral aspect is called the sternum. In turn, the notum of the prothorax is called the pronotum, the notum for the mesothorax is called the mesonotum and the notum for the metathorax is called the metanotum. Continuing with this logic, the mesopleura and metapleura, as well as the mesosternum and metasternum, are   [ 36 ]    abdomen is the largest tagma of the insect, which typically consists of 11–12 segments and is less strongly sclerotized than the head or thorax. Each segment of the abdomen is represented by a sclerotized tergum and sternum. Terga are separated from each other and from the adjacent sterna or pleura by membranes. Spiracles are located in the pleural area. Variation of this ground plan includes the fusion of terga or terga and sterna to form continuous dorsal or ventral shields or a conical tube. Some insects bear a sclerite in the pleural area called a laterotergite. Ventral sclerites are sometimes called laterosternites During the embryonic stage of many insects and the postembryonic stage of primitive insects, 11 abdominal segments are present. In modern insects there is a tendency toward reduction in the number of the abdominal segments, but the primitive number of 11 is maintained during embryogenesis. Variation in abdominal segment number is considerable. If the Apterygota are considered to be indicative of the ground plan for pterygotes, confusion reigns: adult Protura have 12 segments, Collembola have 6. The orthopteran family Acrididae has 11 segments, and a fossil specimen of Zoraptera has a 10-segmented   [ 36 ]     Exoskeleton   [  edit  ]   insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers: the epicuticle which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin and a lower layer called the procuticle The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and hardened .   [ 25 ]    :22–24 The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., caterpillars especially during their larval are the only invertebrates to have developed active flight capability, and this has played an important role in their   [ 25 ]    :186 Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with extracted from the   [ 37 ]      [ 38 ]     Internal   [  edit  ]      [  edit  ]   of an insect can be divided into a brain and a nerve The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's esophagus called the .   [ 25 ]    :57  thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or   [ 39 ]   Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp   has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly   have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic least a few insects have nociceptors cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain .   [ 40 ]   This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to the touch of a heated probe and an unheated one. The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated   [ 41 ]   Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects, there is no consensus that insects feel pain   [ 42 ]       [  edit  ]   insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it   [ 43 ]   Most of this food is ingested in the form of macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins polysaccharides fats and These macromolecules must be broken down by into smaller molecules like and before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the   [ 25 ]    :70–77  (element 30 in numbered diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break   [ 44 ]      [ 45 ]   Some insects, like flies have Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract a significant proportion of the available nutrients from the food   [ 46 ]    :31 The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut midgut and hindgut .  Foregut   [  edit  ]         Stylized diagram of insect digestive tract showing from an insect of the order Orthoptera . first section of the alimentary canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the (mouth), pharynx esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified) which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the   [ 25 ]    :70  starts in (mouth) as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and (mostly amylases strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem there, the pharynx passes food to the esophagus, which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum or fluid-filled structure, as in some Diptera   [ 46 ]    :30–31        Bumblebee defecating: Note the contraction of the abdomen which provides internal  Midgut   [  edit  ]   food leaves the crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in numbered diagram), also known as the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the   [ 46 ]    :32   Hindgut   [  edit  ]   the hindgut (element 16 in numbered diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food particles are joined by to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in   [ 25 ]        [  edit  ]   article: reproductive  reproductive system of female insects consist of a pair of ovaries accessory glands, one or more spermathecae and ducts connecting these parts. The ovaries are made up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be develop being also influenced by ovariole design. Female insects are able make eggs, receive and store sperm, manipulate sperm from different males, and lay eggs. Accessory glands or glandular parts of the oviducts produce a variety of substances for sperm maintenance, transport and fertilization, as well as for protection of eggs. They can produce glue and protective substances for coating eggs or tough coverings for a batch of eggs called oothecae Spermathecae are tubes or sacs in which sperm can be stored between the time of mating and the time an egg is   [ 36 ]    :880  males, the reproductive system is the testis suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct that leads to the outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the seminal vesicle, which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during   [ 36 ]    :885     [  edit  ]         The tube-like heart (green) of the mosquito   extends horizontally across the body, interlinked with the diamond-shaped (also green) and surrounded by (red).

Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart.

As insects get bigger, this type of oxygen transport gets less efficient and thus the heaviest insect currently weighs less than 100g. However, with increased atmospheric oxygen levels, as happened in the late Paleozoic, larger insects were possible, such as dragonflies with wingspans of more than two   [ 48 ]    are many different patterns of demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation, to gas .

In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at   [ 49 ]   Diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special   [ 50 ]      [ 51 ]       [  edit  ]   insect circulatory system utilizes hemolymph a tissue analogous to blood that circulates in the interior of the insect body, while remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open of arthropods characteristic of spiders crustaceans and   [ 52 ]      [ 53 ]     and   [  edit  ]         A pair of   hoverflies mating in majority of insects hatch from eggs The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell chorion that consists of maternal tissue. In contrast to eggs of other arthropods, most insect eggs are drought resistant. This is because inside the chorion two additional membranes develop from embryonic tissue, the amnion and the serosa This serosa secretes a cuticle rich in chitin that protects the embryo against desiccation. In Schizophora however the serosa does not develop, but these flies lay their eggs in damp places, such as rotting   [ 54 ]   Some species of insects, like the cockroach   as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are ovoviviparous The eggs of ovoviviparous animals develop entirely inside the female, and then hatch immediately upon being   [ 7 ]   Some other species, such as those in the genus of cockroaches known as  Diploptera  are viviparous and thus gestate inside the mother and are .

This system is typical in bees and   [ 56 ]   Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms as in the winged which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth   as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects use parthenogenesis a process in which the female can reproduce and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and sexual   [ 57 ]      [ 58 ]   In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for sexual reproduction. Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid .   [ 7 ]   More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive life-histories show adaptations to withstand cold and dry conditions. Some temperate region insects are capable of activity during winter, while some others migrate to a warmer climate or go into a state of torpor .

There are two forms of metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis and complete    [  edit  ]   article: Hemimetabolism   Hemimetabolous insects, those with incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of molts An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was   [ 25 ]    :142    [ 61 ]    insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called nymphs or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until adulthood.

Holometabolism or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo a larva a pupa and the adult or imago In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval   [ 25 ]    :151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis . of the oldest and most successful insect groups, such Endopterygota use a system of complete   [ 25 ]    :143 Complete metamorphosis is unique to a group of certain insect orders including Diptera Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera This form of development is exclusive and not seen in any other  and   [  edit  ]   insects possess very sensitive and, or specialized organs of perception Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many   [ 62 ]   The yellow paper wasp   is known for its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging   [ 63 ]   There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to   [ 64 ]   Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats which helps them avoid   [ 25 ]    :87–94 Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their insects display a rudimentary of ,   [ 65 ]   such as the solitary wasps that prey upon a single species. The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus  Eumenes  is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her  production and   [  edit  ]         Insects have compound eyes and two few insects, such as members of the families Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae Phengodidae Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent The most familiar group are the fireflies beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of  Arachnocampa  (Mycetophilidae, Fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of   [ 66 ]   Some fireflies of the genus  Photuris  mimic the flashing of female  Photinus  species to attract males of that species, which are then captured and   [ 67 ]   The colors of emitted light vary from dull blue Mycetophilidae) to the familiar greens and the rare reds   [ 68 ]    insects, except some species of are able to perceive light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the wavelengths. Color vision has been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years   [ 69 ]     production and   [  edit  ]   were the earliest organisms to produce and sense sounds. Insects make sounds mostly by mechanical action of appendages. In grasshoppers and crickets, this is achieved by stridulation Cicadas make the loudest sounds among the insects by producing and amplifying sounds with special modifications to their body and musculature. The African cicada   has been measured at decibels at a distance of 50cm   [ 70 ]   Some insects, such as the    moths and Hedylid butterflies, can hear ultrasound and take evasive action when they sense that they have been detected by   [ 71 ]      [ 72 ]   Some moths produce ultrasonic clicks that were once thought to have a role in jamming bat echolocation The ultrasonic clicks were subsequently found to be produced mostly by unpalatable moths to warn bats, just as are used against predators that hunt by   [ 73 ]   Some otherwise palatable moths have evolved to mimic these   [ 74 ]   More recently, the claim that some moths can jam bat sonar has been revisited.

Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified and can be used to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera such as the corixids (water boatmen), are known to communicate via underwater   [ 76 ]   Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through using surface-borne vibrational signals is more widespread among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne   [ 77 ]   Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse more in a dense environment (such as foliage so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne   [ 78 ]   The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals are just as diverse as those for producing sound in species use vibrations for communicating within members of the same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the   .

Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly   which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in   [ 83 ]    addition to the use of sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved means for These chemicals, termed semiochemicals are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species.

A small number exhibit some form of where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota called the Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa .   [ 87 ]   In the Carboniferous age, some of the  Meganeura  dragonflies had as much as a 50cm (20in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen.

For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so   [ 92 ]   The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more are among the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait.

According to anthropologist the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or to the abundance of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the and Agriculture of the considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard the prospects of eating insects as a food staple.
