Signed during the presidency of it resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the known to the British and in Canadian history as the of the Bay and including the southern portion of its sister district . two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the parallel in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the United and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power. Britain ceded all of south of the 49th parallel and west to the including all of the River south of that latitude, while the U.S. ceded the northernmost tip of the of above the 49th  Contents   1     2 History     3     4 References     5       [  edit  ]   treaty name is variously cited as respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of ,   [ 1 ]   of Commerce (Fisheries, Boundary and the Restoration of ,   [ 2 ]   and of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of .

The U.S. claim was for return of, or compensation for, slaves that were in British territory or on British naval vessels when the treaty was signed.

The British-chartered Hudson's Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by U.S. fur traders to the area. By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur-bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the . the middle 1840s, the tide of U.S. immigration, as well as a U.S. political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement.
