The company grossed more than $73million in its first year of 1986, Michael Dell brought in Lee Walker, a 51-year-old venture capitalist, as president and chief operating officer, to serve as Michael's mentor and implement Michael's ideas for growing the company. Walker was also instrumental in recruiting members to the board of directors when the company went public in 1988. Walker retired in 1990 due to health, and Michael Dell hired Morton Meyerson, former CEO and president of Data to transform the company from a fast-growing medium-sized firm into a billion-dollar   [ 17 ]    company dropped the PC’s Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30million to $80million from its June 22 public of 3.5million shares at $8.50 a   [ 18 ]   In 1992,  Fortune  magazine included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company   [ 19 ]    1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million in annual revenue. However, Bain consultant persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long   [ 20 ]   Indeed, margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in   [ 21 ]   Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company President and  in 1990s and early   [  edit  ]   Dell did not emphasize the consumer market, due to the higher costs and unacceptably low profit margins in selling to individuals and households; however, this changed when the company’s Internet site took off in 1996 and 1997. While the industry’s average selling price to individuals was going down, Dell’s was going up, as second- and third-time computer buyers who wanted powerful computers with multiple features and did not need much technical support were choosing Dell. Dell found an opportunity among PC-savvy individuals who liked the convenience of buying direct, customizing their PC to their means, and having it delivered in days. In early 1997, Dell created an internal sales and marketing group dedicated to serving the home market and introduced a product line designed especially for individual   [ 21 ]    1997 to 2004, Dell enjoyed steady growth and it gained market share from competitors even during industry slumps. During the same period, rival PC vendors such as Compaq Gateway IBM and would struggle and eventually leave the market or get bought   [ 22 ]   Dell surpassed Compaq to become the largest PC manufacturer in 1999. Operating costs made up only 10 percent of Dell's $35 billion in revenue in 2002, compared with 21 percent of revenue at Hewlett-Packard, 25 percent at Gateway, and 46 percent at   [ 23 ]   In 2002, when Compaq merged with (the fourth-place PC maker), the newly combined Hewlett Packard took the top spot but struggled and Dell soon regained its lead.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Windows on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its   [ 24 ]   Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for $332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; however ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the   [ 23 ]    2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds digital audio players, and printers Chairman and CEO Michael Dell, however, had repeatedly blocked President and COO attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring .

Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with   [ 25 ]    Rollins, Dell began to loosen its ties to Microsoft and Intel, the two companies responsible for Dell's dominance in the PC business. During that time, Dell acquired Alienware ,   [ 28 ]   which introduced several new items to Dell products, including AMD microprocessors. To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned  Disappointments   [  edit  ]   2005, while earnings and sales continued to rise, sales growth slowed considerably, and the company stock lost 25% of its value that   [ 29 ]   By June 2006, the stock traded around $25 USD which was 40% down from July 2005—the high-water mark of the company in the post-dotcom   [ 30 ]      [ 31 ]    slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing PC market, which constituted 66% of Dell's sales, and analysts suggested that Dell needed to make inroads into non-PC businesses segments such as storage, services and servers. Dell's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop   [ 32 ]   however this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company's supply chain, and as competitors such as Hewlett-Packard and Acer made their PC manufacturing operations more efficient to match Dell, weakening Dell's traditional price   [ 33 ]   Throughout the entire PC industry, declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that Dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers (a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory). As a result, the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive PCs than before, which eroded profit   [ 22 ]   The laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the PC market, but Dell produced low-cost notebooks in China like other PC manufacturers which eliminated Dell's manufacturing cost advantages, plus Dell's reliance on Internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box [3]    [ 30 ]   CNET has suggested that Dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers, which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers   [ 32 ]    plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments, Dell was heavily dependent on U.S. corporate PC market, as desktop PCs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue, 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses, and Sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from North and South America, according to its 2006 third-quarter results. However, U.S. shipments of desktop PCs were shrinking. Furthermore, the corporate PC market which purchases PCs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems. The last cycle started around 2002, three or so years after companies started buying PCs ahead of the perceived Y2K problems, and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of Microsoft's (expected in early 2007), putting the next upgrade cycle around   [ 34 ]      [ 35 ]   Heavily depending on PCs, Dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes, while demanding deep cuts from   [ 25 ]    had long stuck by its direct sales model. However consumers had become the main drivers of PC sales in recent   [ 35 ]   yet there had a decline in consumers purchasing PCs through the Web or on the phone, as increasing numbers were visiting consumer electronics retail stores to try out the devices first. Dell's rivals in the PC industry, HP, Gateway and Acer, had a long retail presence and so were well poised to take advantage of the consumer   [ 36 ]   The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer consumer electronics such as flat-panel TVs and MP3   [ 32 ]   Dell responded by experimenting with mall kiosks, plus quasi-retail stores in Texas and New   [ 34 ]    had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices, instead of being an   [ 25 ]      [ 25 ]      [ 36 ]      [ 37 ]   By the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector. Dell's low spending on RD relative to its revenue (compared to IBM and worked well in the commoditized PC market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments, such as MP3 players and later mobile   [ 29 ]   Increasing spending on RD would have cut into the operating margins that the company   [ 4 ]   Dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on PCs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s, however by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete IT solutions and Dell lagged far behind competitors like Hewlett Packard and Oracle.   [ 33 ]    reputation for poor customer service, since 2002, which was exacerbated as it moved call centres offshore and as its growth outstripped its technical support infrastructure, came under increasing scrutiny on the Web. The original Dell model was known for high customer satisfaction when PCs sold for thousands but by the 2000s, the company could not justify that level of service when computers in the same lineup sold for   [ 38 ]   Rollins responded by shifting Dick Hunter from head of manufacturing to head of customer service. Hunter, who noted that Dell's DNA of cost-cutting "got in the way," aimed to reduce call transfer times and have call center representatives resolve inquiries in one call. By 2006, Dell had spent $100 million in just a few months to improve on this, and rolled out DellConnect to answer customer inquiries more quickly. In July 2006, the company started its Direct2Dell blog, and then in February 2007, Michael Dell launched IdeaStorm.com, asking customers for advice including selling Linux computers and reducing the promotional "bloatware" on PCs. These initiatives did manage to cut the negative blog posts from 49% to 22%, as well as reduce the "Dell Hell" prominent on Internet search   [ 30 ]      [ 39 ]    was also criticism that Dell used faulty components for its PCs, particularly the 11.8 million OptiPlex desktop computers sold to businesses and governments from May 2003 to July 2005, that suffered from bad capacitors made by a company called   [ 40 ]   A battery recall in August 2006, as a result of a Dell laptop catching fire caused much negative attention for the company though later, Sony was found responsible for the faulty   [ 22 ]    marked the first year that Dell's growth was slower than the PC industry as a whole. By the fourth quarter of 2006, Dell lost its title of the largest PC manufacturer to rival whose Personal Systems Group was invigorated thanks to a restructuring initiated by their CEO .

However, with the return of Michael Dell as CEO, the company saw immediate changes in operations, the exodus of many senior vice-presidents and new personnel brought in from outside the   [ 34 ]   Michael Dell announced a number of initiatives and plans (part of the "Dell 2.0" initiative) to improve the company's financial performance. These include elimination of 2006 bonuses for employees with some discretionary awards, reduction in the number of managers reporting directly to Michael Dell from 20 to 12, and reduction of bureaucracy Jim Schneider retired as CFO and was replaced by as the company came under an SEC probe for its accounting   [ 45 ]    April 23, 2008, Dell announced the closure of one of its biggest Canadian call-centers in terminating approximately 1100 employees, with 500 of those redundancies effective on the spot, and with the official closure of the center scheduled for the summer. The call-center had opened in 2006 after the city of Ottawa won a bid to host it. Less than a year later, Dell planned to double its workforce to nearly 3,000 workers add a new building. However these plans were reversed, due to a high that made the Ottawa staff relatively expensive, and also as part of Dell's turnaround, which involved moving these call-center jobs offshore to cut   [ 46 ]   The company had also announced the shutdown of its Edmonton Alberta office, losing 900 jobs. In total, Dell announced the ending of about 8,800 jobs in 2007–2008— 10% of its   [ 47 ]    the late 2000s, Dell's "configure to order" approach of manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications from its US facilities was no longer as efficient or competitive with high-volume Asian contract manufacturers as PCs became powerful low-cost   [ 5 ]      [ 48 ]   Dell closed plants that produced desktop computers for the North American market, including the Mort Topfer Manufacturing Center in (original   [ 49 ]      [ 50 ]   and (opened in 1999) in 2008 and early 2009, respectively. The desktop production plant in North received US$ million in incentives from the state and opened in 2005, but ceased operations in November 2010.
