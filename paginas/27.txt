This feature is overly reliant on these Projection images, and there is clearly not enough variation. Can these be limited to one a year or something a little more sensible? 81.108.19.93 talk 11:24, 16 October 2015 you work on getting some more varied pictures featured, the people scheduling TFP will have more variety to choose from.  G RAPPLE      X    11:26, 16 October 2015 images are shown roughly in the order they were promoted to Featured Picture in first with exceptions for relevant dates (such as anniversaries) and to spread out similar topics. See of the In this case User:Strebe worked hard to get several map projections featured, and they're gradually being showcased on the Main Page. After a while they'll be done. If you would like to help select the range of topics for this section, please contribute at picture      talk  12:37, 16 October 2015 (UTC) can check the POTD archives. We have 43 featured map projections, which have been running at the rate of one or two a month for a year and a half or so. As POTD runs on a more or less "first in, first out" basis, there are occasional spurts of similar subjects. Two years ago it was birds. In a year it will be banknotes and Van Gogh talk 15:52, 18 October 2015 one who lends a hand at WP:FPC I agree that users are encouraged to participate in the selection process. ("Outside of the nominator, all voters are expected to have been on Wikipedia for 25 days and to have made a minimum of 100 edits.") But I also agree with the IP user above that the series of map projections has become repetitive. Since we have a large backlog of approved FPs, perhaps the maps could be spread out a bit more? Sca talk 16:03, 18 October 2015 (UTC) exactly, is "one or two a month" not spread out enough? I'll concede that the birds last year could have been spread out a bit better (five a month was perhaps a bit much) but one or two a month is far from problematic. Even this month, we had one projection on October 2 and one on October 16; that's two weeks, not one week. The IP's suggestion that we run "one a year" is clearly untenable considering how many we have, and disrespectful to the images' nominator and talk 23:35, 18 October 2015 OK, I give. (But I'm gonna oppose any further map-projection noms.) Sca talk 00:55, 19 October 2015 (UTC) haven't been any since June 2013, so nobody should have to worry about adding to the number of projections. For talk 01:01, 19 October 2015    [  edit  ]   Everyone..:) I'm New to this site and a computer student as well. Want to start off with some basics regarding the domains Guys any information / blogs / articles from your end will help me  the   [  edit  ]   seems strange as I'm more used to seeing articles like this at AFD with complaints that notability is As the article is mostly conjecture and the main source – Mao himself - didn't even get her age right, I'm quite surprised this passed as an FA. Still, at least it makes a change from the interminable  Banksia  – two so far this month. Along with the usual hurricanes, mushrooms, c. this gives the impression that we're scraping the barrel to find topics for this slot. Is there a place where editors discuss this issue and try to do something about it? I often come across interesting topics but usually stop at putting them forward for DYK (e.g. Perhaps there should be a nursery where more varied topics are encouraged to advance to the next level? talk 12:53, 20 October 2015 fact that you "usually stop at putting [articles] forward for DYK" is telling here: we can't run something in TFA if it's not listed at WP:FA having gone through our featured article process. And the editors who put forth articles there often find themselves dealing with an area of expertise, which is why certain topics are represented more heavily than others. Since this is a volunteer project, there's no way to force people to stop working on the topics they care about and redirect them elsewhere, nor would we be wise to try—so the only alternative to wanting to see different subjects covered is to roll up the sleeves and pitch in.  G RAPPLE      X    13:01, 20 October 2015 ONLY way to fix the problem is to add new types of articles to the pool of articles available to put on the main page at WP:FA In other words, make more featured articles from other topics. There is no other way to fix this, so unless you are working to make articles better, and make them featurable on the main page by the WP:FA standards, you aren't doing any good in fixing the problem.  Jayron     32   14:38, 20 October 2015 conflict with Jayron) What you are looking for is: (a) WP:FANMP the pool of eligible articles (featured articles yet to run on the main page) and (b) WP:TFAR where nominations for Today's Featured Article are discussed - where there are no nominations, the TFA coordinators select something from the pool, doing their best to achieve balance from the options available. You will notice that the pool of eligible articles contains many more options in some areas (e.g. warfare) compared to others (e.g. mathematics, computing, engineering, health, education, philosophy). The best way to see fewer articles that (in your view) scrap the bottom of the barrel is to help review, write and promote alternatives. Bear in mind, of course, that what you find boring others will find interesting and vice versa. The TFA coordinators (I used to be one) have to balance the wheat and the chaff, bearing in mind that (a) different people will disagree on which is which and (b) our purpose is to show the range and detail of the best of our encyclopaedic coverage, not to provide clickbait. Bencherlite    Talk   14:41, 20 October 2015 seems to be a standard niggle from this user. In fact the DYK he mentions is actually pretty low quality and really shouldn't be on the main page at all. But there, your mileage may vary. If you don't get involved in the decision-making process, don't bitch about the fact you don't like the outcome. And most of the things you've ever suggested as interesting to you are as dull as dishwater to me. You see how that works? Everyone has a subjective opinion. This is more about article quality not whether you personally like it. Rambling talk 14:45, 20 October 2015 love seeing this sort of complaint about TFA, as it makes it feel like 2008 all over again, when we had them almost every day (or so it felt). We do have on this subject, but the very best thing you can do is help develop a Featured Article on a topic you find interesting. got a few on the go myself, and I'd welcome help. You'll get to see name in Dweller talk 15:14, 20 October 2015  of international totally spies   [  edit  ]   I have seen that there is a articel about internatioanl winx actors can I make a articel about international ts actors?

Provided you can keep it sourced to secondary and demonstrate that is noteworthy you can start pretty much anything.
