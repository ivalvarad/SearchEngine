Hodgson compared the core mechanics to a "mini-game masquerading as sports   [ 4 ]   William Racer of the  Xbox  OXM praised the fast-paced nature of the game and its eye for detail, and complained about the camera angles and difficulty.

[ 27 ]   Hilary Goldstein of IGN's only complaint about the controls was the camera's looseness. She noted the game's "serious attitude" and "very gritty view of sports", and similar to hockey, felt that the non-disc action was "one of the nicest aspects" of the game. She praised the graphics and environments, surround sound, the array of unlockables, the single-player, and its replay value, but bemoaned the lack of options to change between camera views, the Action view in general, and the indistinguishability between players. Goldstein regarded Deathrow profanity as the "best use of endless cursing in a game...   [ 3 ]   Herold of New York noted violence's centrality to the game and figured that the game's age restrictions were likely due to the "savage profanities", which he felt gave the game personality unlike other sports video games.
