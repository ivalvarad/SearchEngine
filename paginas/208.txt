The dialect is also found in certain Dead Sea Scrolls. Mishnaic Hebrew is considered to be one of the dialects of Classical Hebrew that functioned as a living language in the land of Israel. A transitional form of the language occurs in the other works of Tannaitic literature dating from the century beginning with the completion of the Mishnah.

This Tiberian Hebrew from the 7th to 10th century CE is sometimes called "Biblical Hebrew" because it is used to pronounce the Hebrew Bible; however properly it should be distinguished from the historical Biblical Hebrew of the 6th century BCE, whose original pronunciation must be reconstructed. Tiberian Hebrew incorporates the remarkable scholarship of the Masoretes (from masoret meaning "tradition"), who added and to the Hebrew letters to preserve much earlier features of Hebrew, for use in chanting the Hebrew Bible.

There have been, of course, many deviations from this generalization such as letters to his lieutenants, which were mostly in   [ 41 ]   and Maimonides writings, which were mostly in Arabic ;   [ 42 ]   but overall, Hebrew did not cease to be used for such purposes. This meant not only that well-educated Jews in all parts of the world could correspond in a mutually intelligible language, and that books and legal documents published or written in any part of the world could be read by Jews in all other parts, but that an educated Jew could travel and converse with Jews in distant places, just as priests and other educated Christians could converse in Latin.

Near the end of that century the Jewish activist owing to the ideology of the later Zionism began reviving Hebrew as a modern spoken language. Eventually, as a result of the local movement he created, but more significantly as a result of the new groups of immigrants known under the name of the it replaced a score of languages spoken by Jews at that time. Those languages were Jewish dialects of local languages, including Judaeo-Spanish (also called "Judezmo" and "Ladino"), Yiddish, Judeo-Arabic and Bukhori (Tajiki), or local languages spoken in the such as Russian Persian and Arabic . major result of the literary work of the Hebrew intellectuals along the 19th century was a lexical modernization of Hebrew. New words and expressions were adapted as neologisms from the large corpus of Hebrew writings since the Hebrew Bible, or borrowed from Arabic (mainly by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda) and older Aramaic and Latin. Many new words were either borrowed from or coined after European languages, especially English, Russian, German, and French.

His organizational efforts and involvement with the establishment of schools and the writing of textbooks pushed the vernacularization activity into a gradually accepted movement. It was not, however, until the 1904-1914 that Hebrew had caught real momentum in Ottoman Palestine with the more highly organized enterprises set forth by the new group of immigrants. When the Mandate of recognized Hebrew as one of the country's three official languages (English, Arabic, and Hebrew, in 1922), its new formal status contributed to its diffusion. A constructed modern language with a truly Semitic vocabulary and written appearance, although often European in phonology was to take its place among the current languages of the many saw his work as fanciful or even blasphemous    [ 45 ]   (because Hebrew was the holy language of the Torah and therefore some thought that it should not be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who at the turn of the 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the of the Hebrew The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its way to becoming the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine.

There are many cases, however, where older declined forms are retained (especially in idiomatic expressions and the like), and enclitics are widely used to "decline"  Morphology   [  edit  ]   all Semitic languages, the Hebrew language exhibits a pattern of stems consisting typically of triliteral or 3-consonant (4-consonant roots also exist), from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways: e.g. by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels, and/or adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes . uses a number of that are added to words for various purposes. These are called inseparable prepositions or "Letters of Use"  Hebrew אותיות השימוש, Otiyot Such items include: the definite article ha- /ha/ (="the"); prepositions be- /bə/ (="in"), le- /lə/ (="to"; a shortened version of the preposition el mi- /mi/ (="from"; a shortened version of the preposition min conjunctions ve- /və/ (="and"), she- /ʃe/ (="that"; a shortened version of the Biblical conjunction asher ke- /kə/ (="as", "like"; a shortened version of the conjunction kmo ). vowel accompanying each of these letters may differ from those listed above, depending on the first letter or vowel following it. The rules governing these changes, hardly observed in colloquial speech as most speakers tend to employ the regular form, may be heard in more formal circumstances. For example, if a preposition is put before a word which begins with a moving Shva then the preposition takes the vowel /i/ (and the initial consonant may be weakened): colloquial be-kfar (="in a village") corresponds to the more formal bi-khfar . definite article may be inserted between a preposition or a conjunction and the word it refers to, creating composite words like mé-ha-kfar (="from the village"). The latter also demonstrates the change in the vowel of mi- With be and le the definite article is assimilated into the prefix, which then becomes ba or la Thus be-ha-matos becomes ba-matos (="in the plane"). Note that this does not happen to mé (the form of "min" or "mi-" used before the letter "he"), therefore mé-ha-matos is a valid form, which means "from the  indicates that the given example is grammatically non-standard  .  Syntax   [  edit  ]   most other languages, the vocabulary of the Hebrew language is divided into verbs, nouns, adjectives, and so on, and its sentence structure can be analyzed by terms like object, subject, and so on. However, speakers of languages such as English, French, Urdu or Persian may find the structure of Hebrew sentences quite Hebrew sentences have several correct orders of words. One can change the order of the words in the sentence and keep the same meaning. For example, the sentence "Dad went working", in Hebrew, includes a word for Dad אבא  aba  for went הלך  halaḵ  and for working (to the working place = לעבודה  la-ʿavoda  However, unlike in English, you can put those three words almost in any combination לעבודהאבאהלך/ לעבודההלךאבא/ and so Hebrew, there is no word that is supposed to come before every singular noun (i.e. an article ) sentences do not have to include verbs; the copula in the is omitted (although might be implied). For example, the sentence "I am here" אניפה  anipo  has only two words; one for I אני and one for here פה In the sentence "I am that person" אניהואאדםזה  anihuadamze  the word for "am" corresponds to the word for "he" הוא However, this may also be omitted. Thus, the sentence אניאדםזה is identical in the verb "to have" in English, none of the possession terms in Hebrew is a early had a verb-subject-object ordering, this gradually transitioned to a subject-verb-object   [ 59 ]    direct objects have to be marked with a preposition in Hebrew, and there is a specific preposition את  et  for direct objects that would not have a preposition marker in English. The English phrase "he ate the cake" would in Hebrew be הואאכלאתהעוגה  huakhaletha'ugah  (literally, "He ate את the    [  edit  ]   articles: and         Hebrew is written from right to left using the which is an abjad or consonant-only script of 22 letters. The ancient is similar to those used for Canaanite and Phoenician . [     ] Modern scripts are based on the "square" letter form, known as Ashurit (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A script is used in handwriting: the letters tend to be more circular in form when written in cursive, and sometimes vary markedly from their printed equivalents. The medieval version of the cursive script forms the basis of another style, known as When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letter representing the syllabic onset, or by use of   which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. bet / vet shin / sin and, in some contexts, to indicate the punctuation, accentuation, and musical rendition of Biblical texts (see Cantillation ).  use in   [  edit  ]      example of liturgical     your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported You can the or a to play the clip in your  is a portion of the blessing that is traditionally chanted before the (reading of the    playing this file?
