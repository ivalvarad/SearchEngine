MacArthur replied that he planned to depart on 15   [ 20 ]   when the submarine USS Permit  was scheduled to arrive at Corregidor. However radio broadcasts in the United States calling for MacArthur to be placed in charge in Australia had been picked up by MacArthur's headquarters in Corregidor, and it had to be assumed that the Japanese had heard them too. There were ominous signs: Japanese surface patrols had been stepped up in the area, and there were reports of Japanese destroyers heading north from the southern   [ 25 ]   MacArthur therefore elected not to wait for the Permit but to leave as soon as possible, by PT boat on the night of 11   [ 20 ]   Major General would be left in the decision to depart by PT boat rather than wait for the submarine, Lieutenant B.

MacArthur's decision to use the PT boats for the evacuation of his part dramatically emphasized to the American public the overwhelming odds against which the United States was fighting in the Philippines. It evened an old score with the United States Navy. And since he had a tendency towards claustrophobia and did not relish making the trip on a submerged submarine with a commander whom he did not personally know, it provided an acceptable alternative which he elected to   [ 27 ]     Escape   [  edit  ]    Preparations   [  edit  ]         Lieutenant J. D. Bulkeley, commander of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron and his crews overhauled the PT boats for the voyage. All of the engines had performed hard war service, and had been operated for double the recommended mileage. As a result, they were reduced to operating at half speed. Since there were no replacement parts, the gaskets which normally would have been discarded, had to be carefully cleaned and replaced. Each PT boat would carry twenty of additional fuel on the deck. This reduced the top speed of the boats to about 30 knots (56km/h;   [ 28 ]   To make room for the passengers, Bulkeley had to leave 32 of his men behind, who would be sent to fight as infantry on   [ 29 ]    chief of staff, K. drew up the passenger   [ 30 ]   Rockwell and his chief of staff, Captain Herbert Ray, were ordered to accompany   [ 25 ]   They were already under orders to return by submarine, but this was switched to accompanying MacArthur when his date of departure was brought   [ 29 ]   A States Army Air officer, Major General H. was requested by the States Army Air .   [ 30 ]    was accompanied by his family: his wife Jean, four-year-old son   [ 31 ]   and Arthur's Cantonese  amah  Ah Cheu. MacArthur later defended his decision to take her instead of an American   [ 32 ]   "Few people outside the Orient he wrote, "know how completely a member of the family an amah can become, and Ah Cheu had been with us since Arthur's birth. Because of her relationship to my family, her death would have been certain had she been left   [ 33 ]    case a doctor was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to accompany the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff. They were loyal and experienced, and some of them had been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer Paul P. Rogers. Rogers, who was promoted from private that day, was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to   [ 30 ]    there was no food for the passengers on the PT boats, Jean and MacArthur's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, packed tins of food into four one for each PT   [ 32 ]   Huff removed the number plates from MacArthur's car so they could be used in Australia, and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold. Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur's residence in the had been loaded on board the PT boats, even, in one version of the story, the   [ 33 ]   In fact, each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing 35 pounds (16kg) or less.

The boat would toss crazily back and forth, seeming to hang free in space as though about to breach, and would then break away and go forward with a rush. I recall describing the experience afterward as what it must be like to take a trip in a concrete   [ 43 ]          Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley at the helm of a PT the night, the four boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time looking for the other three boats, but was unable to find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the alternative hiding   [ 44 ]   Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on two hours late at 09:30. There was no sign of the other boats, and Rockwell was far from convinced that Kelly had the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other   [ 45 ]     PT-32 which had only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what appeared to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from   [ 46 ]   He ordered his crew to man the .50-caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes. General Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look though the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but PT-41 carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby   [ 47 ]    the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 made their way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34 There was a discussion about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to be sure to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34 .   [ 48 ]   Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for de as   [ 49 ]          Route of MacArthur's escape by PT boat (red) and B-17 19:00, about an hour after they had left Tagauayan, PT-34 and PT-41 spotted a Japanese cruiser. Bulkeley made a sharp turn due west, and headed at top speed, about 20 knots (37km/h; 23mph), into the setting sun. Whether because of the high waves, the glare of the sun, or simple inattentiveness, the cruiser did not spot   [ 50 ]      [ 46 ]   After midnight, the weather began to worsen, with heavy swells and sporadic squalls. Kelly later foaming waves fifteen or twenty feet high thundering over the cockpit, drenching everybody. Our binoculars were full of water and our eyes so continuously drenched with stinging salt that we couldn't see, in addition to which it was pitch-black. We were making good speed through strange waters with islands all around us. We could see the outlines of the big onesâ€”Negros and Mindanaoâ€”very dimly against the horizon through the storm.

I wouldn't do duty on one of these for anything in the worldâ€”you can have   [ 51 ]    dawn, the winds and swells had subsided, but the delay caused by the bad weather had slowed the two boats, and they now had to travel across the in daylight. Cagayan was sighted shortly after 06:30 on 13 March. Although PT-34 had led all the way from Tagauayan, Kelly now let Bulkeley take the lead, as he had the channel charts. PT-41 therefore pulled up at the wharf first, with MacArthur on the bow. They were met by Colonel William Morse, an officer on the staff of the Brigadier General William F. Sharp, the commander of U.S. forces on Mindanao. MacArthur told Bulkeley "I'm giving every officer and man here the for gallantry. You've taken me out of the jaws of death, and I won't forget   [ 52 ]    few hours later, PT-35 reached Cagayan. Willoughby later were behind schedule and reached the north coast of Mindanao in broad daylight. It was a clear, dazzling day. Fortunately, no Japanese planes cut across the blue sky, though the enemy was known to make regular mail flights from Mindanao to Luzon. We were pretty conspicuous as the hours dragged   [ 53 ]    Permit under the command of Lieutenant G. reached Tagauayan on 13 March, and found PT-32 With two of his three engines out of action, Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer seaworthy. He had Chapple destroy the boat with Permit' deck gun. Chapple then took the fifteen PT-32 crewmen back to Corregidor. There, eight of the crew were disembarked, while Chapple embarked forty more passengers, thirty-six of them codebreakers Nonetheless, Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol, which he did. He finally reached Australia on 7   [ 54 ]   Unaware of this, Bulkeley attempted to locate PT-32 .   [ 55 ]   Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft, including a P-35 and a P-40 in the hope of finding   [ 56 ]     Aircraft   [  edit  ]   commander of U.S. Army Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General H. received a radiogram from General Marshall in Washington, D.C., alerting him that MacArthur would be requesting bombers to transport his party from Mindanao to Australia. A subsequent message from MacArthur requested his "most experienced pilots, and the best available planes in top   [ 57 ]   but the only long-range aircraft that Brett had were B-17 Flying of the Bombardment which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the East Indies .   [ 57 ]   He therefore approached F. the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area, to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived Navy B-17s. Leary, who had a reputation for refusing requests unless he could see how the Navy would benefit, turned Brett   [ 58 ]          Boeing B-17E Flying therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Two were forced to turn back with engine trouble. One of the others accidentally dumped 300 US gallons (1,100l; 250impgal) of its fuel. The pilot flew on, and nearly made it to Monte but, just a few miles from his destination, the fuel tanks ran dry and the engines stopped. The B-17 crash landed in the sea. Two of the crew were killed, but the rest made it to shore, and thence to Del Monte Field. Only one B-17, piloted by Lieutenant reached Del Monte, and this B-17 was in poor condition, with no brakes and a faulty supercharger Sharp ordered it back to Australia before MacArthur arrived. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease made the return trip, carrying sixteen   [ 49 ]      [ 58 ]    with the arrival of PT-35 all of the passengers reached Mindanao safely, but there were no aircraft at Del Monte Field to meet them. They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged in the guest houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked 25 miles (40km) in the hope that the general would have some news about him. He did not, but the fact that she was aware of MacArthur's presence was disturbing to the party, as the Japanese were only 30 miles (48km) away, at Davao on the south coast of   [ 59 ]      [ 60 ]    went back to Leary, expecting to be turned down again, but this time, Leary gave Brett the aircraft he   [ 58 ]   The newly formed Reconnaissance manned the   [ 61 ]   One B-17 turned back, but two made it to Del Monte Field on 16 March, landing in the dark on a runway lit by   [ 62 ]   Lieutenant Frank P. Bostrom, the pilot of the first plane, calculated that everyone could be carried in just two planes if they left most of their baggage behind. They divided into two groups and the two bombers took off at 01:30 on 17 March. MacArthur rode in the radio operator's seat, which did not need to be manned as the aircraft were travelling under radio   [ 63 ]   For most of the passengers, the trip was dark and cold, with only a blanket between them and the metal skin of the   [ 64 ]    the two planes approached Darwin word was received that a Japanese air raid was in progress there. The two B-17s therefore flew on to where they touched down at 09:30. MacArthur awarded Silver Stars to the crews of the two   [ 63 ]   Brett's chief of staff, Brigadier General was on hand to greet them, and Brett had sent two National DC-3s to bring them to   [ 58 ]   However, Jean now refused to fly any further, so MacArthur asked for a motorcade to take them to the nearest railway station, at Sutherland had received word of an incoming Japanese air raid, and asked Morhouse to intervene. Morhouse told MacArthur that Arthur, who had suffered badly from seasickness and airsickness, was on an intravenous feed, and could not guarantee that he would survive a 1,000-mile (1,600km) trip across the desert. MacArthur then agreed to take the planes to Alice Springs. Sutherland had Huff hurry everyone onto the aircraft, which took off when the air raid siren   [ 65 ]    Alice Springs, the party split up. MacArthur, his family, Sutherland, Morhouse and Huff took a special train that Brett had borrowed from the Australians, while the rest of the staff flew down to Melbourne via Adelaide in the   [ 66 ]   His famous speech, in which he said, "I came through and I shall return", was first made at Terowie a small town in on 20 March, where he changed   [ 67 ]   On 21 March, MacArthur's journey was completed when his train rolled into Street where he was greeted by the Australian for the .   [ 68 ]     Aftermath   [  edit  ]   April 1942, Bulkeley led his squadron in an attack on the Kuma  The PT boats scored a hit on the cruiser, but the torpedo was a dud and failed to explode. No damage   [ 69 ]   With the loss of there were no more torpedoes, so the active careers of the remaining boats of Bulkeley's squadron came to an end. MacArthur gave PT boat officers a high priority to be flown out from Mindanao. Bulkeley was flown out on MacArthur's orders on 13   [ 70 ]   Knox, Kelly and Akers were evacuated on 23 April, and Brantingham also made one of the last flights out from Mindanao. Sharp surrendered on Mindanao on 10   [ 71 ]      [ 72 ]    subsequently nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor.
