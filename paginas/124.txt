It is fleshy throughout, except for the seeds. It does not have a special "line of weakness" along which it splits to release the seeds when ripe (i.e. it is indehiscent ).   [ 13 ]   A berry may develop from an ovary with one or more carpels (the female reproductive structures of a flower). The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary, but there are some non-fleshy examples such as peppers with air rather than pulp around their seeds. The differences between the everyday and botanical uses of "berry" result in three categories: those fruits which are berries under both definitions; those fruits which are botanical berries but not commonly known as berries; and those parts of plants commonly known as berries which are not botanical berries, and may not even be kinds of     – berries under both     – botanically berries, but not commonly described as     – botanically aggregate     berries – botanically stone fruits or     berry – botanically a modified seed-bearing conifer  under both definitions include blueberries cranberries lingonberries and the fruits of many other members of the as well as gooseberries and elderberries The fruits of some "currants"  Ribes  species), such as blackcurrants redcurrants and are botanical berries, and are treated as horticultural berries (or as soft fruit in the UK), even though their most commonly used names do not include the word berries not commonly known as berries include bananas ,   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]   tomatoes ,   [ 1 ]   grapes eggplants or aubergines persimmons watermelons and pumpkins . are several different kinds of fruits which are commonly called berries but are not botanical berries.
