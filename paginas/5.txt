The first confraternity, the was created as a social organization for promising students. However, as new confraternities were formed, they became increasingly violent through the 1970s and 1980s.

Roughly analogous to the and of the Pyrates Confraternity proved popular among students, even after the original members moved on. Membership was open to any promising male student, regardless of tribe or race, but selection was stringent and most applicants were denied. For almost 20 years, the Pyrates were the only confraternity on Nigerian   [ 4 ]     Schism   [  edit  ]   the late 1960s, campuses were roiled by the wracking the country. Details are contested, but it appears that in 1972 Bolaji Carew and several others were expelled from the Pyrates for failing to meet expected standards. In reaction to this and other events, the Pyrates registered themselves under the name National Association of Seadogs (NAS) and, at least one source states, pulled the confraternity out of the universities. Carew went on to found the Buccaneers Confraternity (also called the National Associations of Sea Lords), largely copying the Seadogs' structure, symbols and   [ 4 ]   A major impetus for the creation of new confraternities was the fact that members of the new groups simply did not meet the high academic and intellectual standards set by the Seadogs, and thus considered the original organization to be   [ 5 ]   However, Soyinka would later point to individuals who became accustomed to exerting power in the rigidly hierarchical confraternity, and were unwilling to give it up, as to blame for the initial   [ 6 ]   As new groups formed, inter-group tensions led to fighting, though these were initially limited to   [ 7 ]    Supreme Eiye Confraternity (also known as the National Association of Air Lords) was formed in the University of Ibadan in 1965.In the 1980s confraternities spread throughout the over 300 institutions of higher education in the country.

The coup of in 1983 caused a large degree of political tension. Military leaders, beginning in the 1980s, began to see the confraternities as a check on the and university staff, who were the only organized groups opposing military rule. The confraternities were thus provided payment and weapons to use against student activists, though the weapons were often used in deadly inter-confraternity   [ 8 ]   Sociologist Emeka Akudi noted that some university vice-chancellors protected confraternities which were known to be violent and used them to attack students deemed   [ 7 ]   During this period the confraternities introduced a new tradition of carrying out religious including Vodun before any other   [ 4 ]   Perhaps in reaction to the changes, in 1984 Wole Soyinka declared that the Seadogs should not operate on any university   [ 7 ]     from the   [  edit  ]   the early 1990s, as of Second drew near, confraternity activities expanded dramatically in the as confraternities engaged in a bloody struggle for supremacy. The Family Confraternity (the Campus Mafia or the Mafia), which modeled itself after the Italian Mafia emerged. Shortly after their arrival, several students were expelled from State for cheating and "cultism", a reference to the voodoo-practicing confraternities, which marked the beginning of a shift of confraternity activities from the university to off   [ 4 ]   However the consolidation of confraternity activities outside Nigerian University campuses was boosted by the nationwide renouncement of cultism by university students and the breakdown of traditional campus cults all over the country as a result of amnesty granted to all renounced cultists at the onset of the present democratic government. This led to migration of cultists from the campuses to residential neighbourhoods and streets as campuses were no more safe haven for them. Incompetence of government officials and inadequate facilities to police campuses by University Authorities led to the resurgence of cultism in the campuses as renounced cultists who could not be protected by the Law, went back to their cult groups to seek protection from rival groups who had discerned their identity as a result of the renouncement ceremony. This resulted in a situation where cult groups were now well established in- and outside the [     ]  Brotherhood of the Blood (also known as Two-Two (Black Beret)), another notorious confraternity, was founded at Enugu State University of Science and Technology. Another cult, the Victor Charlie Boys, was established by Augustine Ahiazu when he was vice-chancellor of the State University of Science and The cults established in the early 1990s are legion; they include Second Son of Satan (SSS), Night Cadet, Sonmen, Mgba Mgba Brothers, Temple of Eden, Trojan Horse, Jurists, White Bishops, Gentlemen Clubs, Fame, Executioners, Dreaded Friend of Friends, Eagle Club, Black Scorpion, Red Sea Horse and Fraternity of   [ 4 ]    Klansmen Konfraternity expanded its influence by creating a "street and creek" wing, Deebam, to fight for and control territory outside of the universities through violence and crime. In response, the Supreme Vikings Confraternity (SVC) established its own street and creek group, Deewell. When Dewell was unable to match Deebam, the SVC created a second confraternity wing, the Icelanders (German), which would eventually be led by militia leader The Outlaws, another well-known street and creek confraternity, began as a splinter group of the Icelanders   [ 4 ]    the late 1990s, all-female confraternities began to be formed. These include the Black Brazier (Bra Bra), the Viqueens, Daughters of Jezebel, and the Damsel. Female confraternities have supplied spies for allied male confraternities as well as acting as prostitution   [ 4 ]     Awolowo University   [  edit  ]   article: Awolowo University  July 10, 1999, one of the most notable single attacks occurred at Awolowo (OAU) in Ife OAU had been considered one of the safest universities in the country, largely due to student-organized resistance to the confraternities. After one cult member was shot and killed during an attempted kidnapping in 1991, the confraternities appeared to stay away from the university. In February 1999, student leaders organized a campus-wide search, which found eight secret cult members who were stockpiling machine guns and other weapons in their dorm room. This enraged the Black Axe confraternity, who organized a murder squad that hacked the student union secretary-general to death in his bed and targeted other student   [ 9 ]      [ 10 ]    a student assembly called the following day, the president of the who had escaped the killers by leaping from his window, demanded the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Wole Omole, who was seen as obstructing efforts to fight confraternities, such as by refusing to expel the eight cultists who had been found stockpiling weapons.

In one case, students worried about police leniency stormed a police station to re-seize a suspect they had previously turned   [ 9 ]    Education Minister later dismissed Omole and ordered university administrators to eradicate confraternities from their campuses by September   [ 9 ]   In response, hundreds of cult members publicly renounced their confraternity and cult-associated violence temporarily   [ 7 ]       [  edit  ]   the first weeks of the school year, confraternity alumni and members swarm campuses recruiting new members. Initiation ceremonies normally involve severe beatings, in order to test their endurance, as well as ingestion of a liquid mixed with blood. Male initiates may sometimes be required to pass an additional hurdle before becoming full members, including raping a popular female student or a female member of the university staff. Among the all-female Jezebels or Amazons, prospective members may be required to undergo six rounds of rough sexual intercourse or fight with against a group of women or against a much stronger   [ 11 ]   Cults also charge annual membership fees of between 10,000 (US$80) and 30,000   [ 8 ]    criminal activity for cults include intimidating professors into giving high grades, including by burning their cars or briefly abducting their   [ 8 ]   Since the 1980s, confraternities have murdered people who are thought to have 'stolen' a member's girlfriend, or in the case of female groups.
