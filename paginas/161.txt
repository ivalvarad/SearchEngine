Submarine-launched ballistic missiles operate in a different way from cruise . submarine-launched ballistic missiles are closely related to ballistic (range of over 5,500km), and in many cases SLBMs and ICBMs may be part of the same family of  Contents   1 History    1.1     1.2 and further     1.3 and Trident     1.4 and Typhoon     1.5     2 of     3     4     5 References     6     History   [  edit  ]      [  edit  ]   first practical design of a submarine-based launch platform was developed by the Germans near the end of War involving a launch tube which contained a ballistic variant and was towed behind a submarine, known by the code-name   The war ended before it could be tested, but the engineers who had worked on it went on to for the and USSR on their SLBM programs. These and other early SLBM systems required vessels to be surfaced when they fired missiles, but launch systems eventually were adapted to allow underwater launching in the 1950-1960s. A converted (Zulu-IV class) submarine launched the world's first SLBM, an R-11FM (SS-N-1 Scud-A, naval variant of the SS-1 Scud on 16 September   [ 1 ]   Five additional Project V611 and AV611 (Zulu-V class) submarines became the world's first operational ballistic missile submarines (SSBs) with two R-11FM missiles each, entering service in   [ 2 ]    States initially worked on a sea-based variant of the Jupiter ballistic projecting four of the large, liquid-fueled missiles per   [ 3 ]   Rear Admiral F. "Red" headed a Special Project Office to develop Jupiter for the Navy, beginning in late   [ 4 ]      [ 5 ]   However, at the submarine warfare conference in 1956, physicist stated that a physically small one-megaton warhead could be produced for the relatively small, solid-fueled ,   [ 6 ]   and this prompted the Navy to leave the Jupiter program in December of that year. Soon of Naval Admiral concentrated all Navy strategic research on Polaris, still under Admiral Raborn's Special Project   [ 7 ]   All US SLBMs have been solid-fueled while all Soviet and Russian SLBMs have been liquid-fueled except for the Russian which entered service in        world's first operational SSBN was USS (SSBN-598) with 16 missiles, which entered service in December 1959 and conducted the first SSBN deterrent patrol November 1960-January   [ 8 ]   also conducted the first successful submerged SLBM launch with a Polaris A-1 on 20 July   [ 9 ]   Forty days later, the Soviet Union made its first successful underwater launch of a submarine ballistic missile in the White Sea, on 10 September 1960 from the same converted reporting Zulu-IV class) submarine that first launched the   [ 10 ]   The Soviets were only a year behind the US with their first SSBN, the of (Hotel class), commissioned in November 1960. However, the Hotel class carried only three (NATO reporting name SS-N-4) each and had to surface and raise the missile to   [ 11 ]   Submerged launch was not an operational capability for the Soviets until 1963, when the (SS-N-5) was first backfitted to Project 658 (Hotel class) and (Golf class)   [ 12 ]   The Soviet Union was able to beat the U.S. in launching and testing the first SLBM with a live nuclear warhead, an R-13 that detonated in the Test Range in the Arctic Ocean, doing so on 20 October   [ 13 ]   just ten days before the gigantic 50Mt detonation in the same general area. The United States eventually conducted a similar test in the Pacific Ocean on 6 May 1962, with a Polaris A-2 launched from USS (SSBN-608) as part of the series The first Soviet SSBN with 16 missiles was the (Yankee class), which first entered service in 1967 with 32 boats completed by   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]   By the time the first Yankee was commissioned the US had built 41 SSBNs, nicknamed the for ".   [ 16 ]      [ 17 ]          French and in cross-section of a  and further   [  edit  ]   short range of the early SLBMs dictated basing and deployment locations. By the late 1960s the Polaris A-3 was deployed on all US SSBNs with a range of 4,600 kilometres (2,500nmi), a great improvement on the 1,900 kilometres (1,000nmi) range of Polaris A-1. The A-3 also had three warheads that landed in a pattern around a single   [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]   The Yankee class was initially equipped with the missile (SS-N-6) with a range of 2,400 kilometres (1,300nmi). The US was much more fortunate in its basing arrangements than the Soviets. Thanks to NATO and the US possession of Guam US SSBNs were permanently forward deployed at Advanced Refit Sites in Scotland and Guam by the middle 1960s, resulting in short transit times to patrol areas near the Soviet Union. The SSBN facilities at the Advanced Refit Sites were austere, with only a and dry Converted merchant ships Sealift cargo ships) were provided to ferry missiles and supplies to the sites. With two rotating crews per boat, about one-third of the total US force could be in a patrol area at any time. The Soviet bases, in the Murmansk area for the Atlantic and the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky area for the Pacific required their SSBNs to make a long transit (through NATO-monitored waters in the Atlantic) to their mid-ocean patrol areas to hold the continental United States CONUS at risk. This resulted in only a small percentage of the Soviet force occupying patrol areas at any time, and was a great motivation for longer-range Soviet SLBMs, which would allow them to patrol close to their bases, in areas sometimes referred to as "deep bastions". These missiles were the series (SS-N-8, SS-N-18, SS-N-23), equipped on 667B, 667BD, 667BDR, and (Delta-I through Delta-IV   [ 20 ]   The SS-N-8, with a range of 7,700 kilometres (4,200nmi), entered service on the first Delta-I boat in 1972, before the Yankee class was even completed. A total of 43 Delta-class boats of all types entered service 1972-90, with the SS-N-18 on the Delta III class and the (SS-N-23) on the Delta IV   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]      [ 23 ]      [ 24 ]   The new missiles had increased range and eventually Multiple Independently-targeted Re-entry Vehicles MIRV multiple warheads that could each hit a different   [ 25 ]     and Trident   [  edit  ]   the US did not commission any new SSBNs from 1967 through 1981, they did introduce two new SLBMs. Thirty-one of the 41 original US SSBNs were built with larger diameter launch tubes with future missiles in mind. In the early 1970s the (C-3) entered service, and those 31 SSBNs were backfitted with   [ 26 ]   Poseidon offered a massive MIRV capability of up to 14 warheads per   [ 27 ]   Like the Soviets, the US also desired a longer-range missile that would allow SSBNs to be based in CONUS. In the late 1970s the I (C-4) with a range of 7,400 kilometres (4,000nmi) and eight MIRV warheads was backfitted to 12 of the Poseidon-equipped   [ 28 ]      [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]   The SSBN facilities (primarily a and dry of the base at Rota, Spain were disestablished and the Submarine Base King's in Georgia was built for the Trident I-equipped  and Typhoon   [  edit  ]         A II just after the United States and the Soviet Union commissioned larger SSBNs designed for new missiles in 1981. The American large SSBN was the  Ohio also called the "Trident submarine", with the largest SSBN armament ever of 24 missiles, initially Trident I but built with much larger tubes for the II (D-5) which entered service in   [ 31 ]      [ 32 ]   The entire class was converted to use Trident II by the early 2000s. Trident II offered a range of over 8,000 kilometres (4,300nmi) with eight larger MIRV warheads than Trident I. When the USS Ohio (SSBN-726) commenced sea trials in 1980, two of the first ten US SSBNs had their missiles removed to comply with SALT treaty requirements; the remaining eight were converted to attack submarines (SSN) by the end of 1982. These were all in the Pacific, and the Guam SSBN base was disestablished; the first several Ohio boats used new Trident facilities at Submarine Base Washington Eighteen Ohio boats were commissioned by   [ 33 ]   four of which were converted as cruise missile submarines (SSGN) in the 2000s to comply with treaty requirements. The Soviet large SSBN was the 941 famous as the Typhoon-class (and not to be confused with the 971 called "Akula" by NATO). The Typhoons were the largest submarines ever built at 48,000 tons submerged. They were armed with 20 of the new (SS-N-20) missiles with a range of 8,300 kilometres (4,500nmi) and 10 MIRV warheads. Six Typhoons were commissioned   [ 34 ]   A Typhoon was the subject of novel  Hunt for Red  .    [  edit  ]   SSBN construction terminated for over 10 years in Russia and slowed in the US with the of the Soviet and the end of the in 1991. The US rapidly decommissioned its remaining 31 older SSBNs, with a few converted to other roles, and the base at Holy Loch was disestablished. Most of the former Soviet SSBN force was gradually scrapped under the provisions of the Cooperative Threat agreement through   [ 35 ]   By that time the Russian SSBN force stood at six Delta-IVs, three Delta-IIIs, and a lone Typhoon used as a testbed for new missiles (the R-39s unique to the Typhoons were reportedly scrapped in 2012). Upgraded missiles such as the (SS-N-23 Sineva) were developed for the Deltas. In 2013 the Russians commissioned the first also called the Dolgorukiy class after the lead vessel. By 2015 two others had entered service. This class is intended to replace the aging Deltas, and carries 16 solid-fuel missiles, with a reported range of 10,000 kilometres (5,400nmi) and six MIRV warheads. The US is designing a for the Ohio however, as of early 2015 none have been laid  missile have been of great strategic importance for the USA, Russia, and other nuclear powers since they entered service in the as they can hide from and fire their nuclear weapons with virtual impunity. This makes them immune to a directed against nuclear forces, allowing each side to maintain the capability to launch a retaliatory even if all land-based missiles have been destroyed. This relieves each side of the necessity to adopt a on posture, with its grave attendant risk of accidental nuclear war. Additionally, the deployment of highly accurate missiles on ultra-quiet submarines allows an attacker to sneak up close to the enemy coast and launch a missile on a depressed trajectory (a non-optimal which trades off reduced throw-weight for a faster and lower path, effectively reducing the time between launch and impact), thus opening the possibility of a .
