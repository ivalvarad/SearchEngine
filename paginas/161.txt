Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem. Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem. Some introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact. Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests. They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example. In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains   [ 1 ]   A of some introduced is given in a separate effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists, governments, farmers and  Contents   1 Terminology     2 of    2.1     2.2     3     4    4.1 commonly introduced     5 exotic     6 species on    6.1     7 species on a planetary     8     9 Notes     10     Terminology   [  edit  ]   terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons. Other terms with somewhat similar meanings) with introduced are acclimatized adventive naturalized and immigrant However this terms refer to a subset of introduced species, those that have become established and can reproduce without human assistance. The term invasive refers only to those species that, in addition to becoming established, spread beyond the place of introduction. For practical purposes this term is applied only to those invasive species that cause the broadest and most widely used sense, an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms; these adequately fit the basic definition given above. However, some sources add to that basic definition: "...and are now reproducing in the   [ 2 ]   which removes from consideration as introduced all of those species raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people. With respect to plants, these latter are in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated following definition from the States Environmental Protection (EPA), although perhaps lacking ecological sophistication, is more typical: "A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area. Also called an exotic or non-native   [ 3 ]   Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an "introduced species" such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may only occur in cultivation, under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance. Such species might be termed "naturalized", "established", "wild non-native species". If they further spread beyond the place of introduction they are called "invasive". The transition from introduction, to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of   [ 4 ]   Introduced species are essentially "non-native" species. Invasive species are those introduced species that spread-widely or quickly, and cause harm, be that to the   [ 5 ]   human health, other valued resources or the economy. There have been calls from scientists to consider a species "invasive" only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may   [ 6 ]    to a practical definition, an is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location, spreading (invading) by natural means. The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm. For example, U.S. Executive Order 13112 (1999) defines "invasive species" as "an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human   [ 7 ]   The biological definition of invasive species, on the other hand, makes no reference to the harm they may cause, only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original some argue that "invasive" is a loaded word and harm is difficult to   [ 2 ]   the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas where they are not native, sometimes with, usually without, much regard to the harm that could a regulatory perspective, it is neither desirable nor practical to simply list as undesirable or outright ban all non-native species (although the of has adopted an approach that comes close to this). Regulations require a definitional distinction between non-natives that are deemed especially onerous and all others. Introduced that are as invasive, best fit the definition of an Early detection and rapid response is the most effective strategy for regulating a pest species and reducing economic and environmental impacts of an introduction   [ 8 ]    the and Countryside Act prevents the introduction of any animal not naturally occurring in the wild, and also any of a list of both animals or plants which have been introduced previously and have proved to be  of   [  edit  ]   definition a species is considered "introduced" when its transport into an area outside of its native range is human mediated. Introductions by humans can be described as either intentional or accidental. Intentional introductions have been motivated by individuals or groups who either (1) believe that the newly introduced species will be in some way beneficial to humans in its new location or, (2) as is the case with pythons in the Everglades, species are introduced intentionally but with no regard to the potential impact. Unintentional or accidental introductions are most often a byproduct of human movements, and are thus unbound to human motivations. Subsequent range expansion of introduced species may or may not involve human    [  edit  ]   that humans intentionally transport to new regions can subsequently become successfully established in two ways. In the first case, organisms are purposely released for establishment in the wild. It is sometimes difficult to predict whether a species will become established upon release, and if not initially successful, humans have made repeated introductions to improve the probability that the species will survive and eventually reproduce in the wild. In these cases it is clear that the introduction is directly facilitated by human the second case, species intentionally transported into a new region may escape from captive or cultivated populations and subsequently establish independent breeding populations. Escaped organisms are included in this category because their initial transport to a new region is human the most common motivation for introducing a species into a new place is that of economic gain. Examples of species introduced for the purposes of benefiting agriculture aquaculture or other economic activities are   [ 9 ]   was first introduced to the United States as a potential food source. The was released in Southeast Asia with the intent that it be used as a protein source, and subsequently to places like Hawaii to establish a food industry. In Alaska, foxes were introduced to many islands to create new populations for the fur trade. About twenty species of African and European have established themselves in Australia after deliberate introduction by the Dung Beetle in an effort to reduce the impact of livestock manure. The timber industry promoted the introduction of Monterey pine   from California to Australia and New Zealand as a commercial timber crop. These examples represent only a small subsample of species that have been moved by humans for economic have also been important in supporting recreation activities or otherwise increasing human enjoyment. Numerous fish and game animals have been introduced for the purposes of sport fishing and hunting as invasive The introduced amphibian   that threatens the endemic California salamander   was introduced to California as a source of bait for   [ 10 ]   Pet animals have also been frequently transported into new areas by humans, and their escapes have resulted in several successful introductions, such as those of feral cats and plants have been introduced with the intent of aesthetically improving public recreation areas or private properties. The introduced for example occupies a prominent status in many of Canada's   [ 11 ]   The transport of for landscaping use has and continues to be a source of many introductions. Some of these species have escaped horticultural control and become invasive Notable examples include and . other cases, species have been translocated for reasons of "cultural nostalgia," which refers to instances in which humans who have migrated to new regions have intentionally brought with them familiar organisms. Famous examples include the introduction of starlings to North America by Englishman a lover of the works of Shakespeare and the chairman of the Acclimatization who, it is rumoured, wanted to introduce all of the birds mentioned in Shakespeare's plays into the United States. He deliberately released eighty starlings into Central Park in New York City in 1890, and another forty in another prominent example is the introduction of the to Australia by one a British landowner who had the rabbits released on his estate in Victoria because he missed hunting them. A more recent example is the introduction of the wall to North America by a Cincinnati boy, George Rau, around 1950 after a family vacation to   [ 12 ]    introductions have also been undertaken with the aim of ameliorating environmental problems. A number of fast spreading plants such as and kudzu have been introduced as a means of erosion control. Other species have been introduced as agents to control and involves the purposeful introduction of a of the target species with the intention of reducing its numbers or controlling its special case of introduction is the reintroduction of a species that has become locally endangered or extinct, done in the interests of   [ 13 ]   Examples of successful reintroductions include wolves to National in the U.S., and the to parts of England and Scotland. Introductions or translocations of species have also been proposed in the interest of which advocates the introduction of new individuals into genetically depauperate populations of endangered or threatened   [ 14 ]    above examples highlight the intent of humans to introduce species as a means of incurring some benefit. While these benefits have in some cases been realized, introductions have also resulted in unforeseen costs, particularly when introduced species take on characteristics of invasive species can become such a common part of an environment, culture, and even diet that little thought is given to their geographic origin. For example, soybeans, kiwi fruit, wheat and all livestock except the and the turkey are non-native species to North America. Collectively, non-native crops and livestock comprise 98% of US   [ 15 ]   These and other benefits from non-natives are so vast that, according to the Congressional Research Service, they probably exceed the   [ 16 ]       [  edit  ]   introductions occur when species are transported by human vectors. For example, three species of rat (the black, Norway and Polynesian) have spread to most of the world as hitchhikers on ships. There are also numerous examples of marine organisms being transported in one being the Over 200 species have been introduced to the Francisco in this manner making it the most heavily invaded estuary in the   [ 17 ]   Increasing rates of human travel are providing accelerating opportunities for species to be accidentally transported into areas in which they are not considered native. There is also the accidental release of the Africanized honey bees (AHB), known colloquially as "killer bees" or to Brazil in 1957 and the to the United States. The insect commonly known as the marmorated stink was introduced accidentally in Pennsylvania. Another form of unintentional introductions is when an intentionally introduced plant carries a parasite or herbivore with it. Some become invasive, for example the accidentally introduced with the ornamental plant, oleander .    [  edit  ]   non-native plants have been introduced into new territories, initially as either or for erosion control, stock feed, or forestry. Whether an exotic will become an is seldom understood in the beginning, and many non-native ornamentals languish in the trade for years before suddenly naturalizing and becoming for example, originated in China, and have been carried to much of the populated world. Tomatoes are native to the Andes. Squash (pumpkins), maize (corn), and tobacco are native to the Americas, but were introduced to the Old World. Many introduced species require continued human intervention to survive in the new environment. Others may become feral, but do not seriously compete with natives, but simply increase the biodiversity of the  Dandelions are also introduced species to North very troublesome marine species in southern Europe is the seaweed   Caulerpa was first observed in the in 1984, off the coast of Monaco By 1997, it had covered some 50km².

Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural predator of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied niche An example of this occurrence would be the introduction of mice on Gough Island, which currently have no predators and are feeding on endangered additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions, and cannot readily escape danger.

Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant which threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish  Rabbits introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island.

Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including  Sparrows which were brought to control insects upon the introduced grain crops, have displaced native birds as have and cockatoos (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of Auckland City such as the . much of New Zealand the Australian has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced . notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the tail and the Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit.
