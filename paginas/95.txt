While the Democratic had earlier been a popular party for farmers, this changed during War when the party had mainly defended the interests of industrialists and consumer   [ 14 ]   When was introduced in 1919, the new farmers' parties won significant electoral support, especially in Zürich and Bern and eventually also gained representation in parliament and   [ 15 ]   By 1929, the coalition of farmers' parties had gained enough influence to get one of their leaders, elected to the Federal 1936, a representative party was founded on the national level, called the of Farmers, Traders and (BGB). During the 1930s, the BGB entered the mainstream of Swiss politics as a right-wing conservative party in the bourgeois bloc. While the party opposed any kind of socialist ideas such as internationalism and anti-militarism it sought to represent local Swiss traders and farmers against big business and international   [ 15 ]    BGB contributed strongly to the establishment of the Swiss national ideology known as the   (Spiritual Defence of the Nation), which was largely responsible for the growing Swiss sociocultural and political cohesion from the 1930s. In the party's fight against left-wing ideologies, sections of party officials and farmers voiced understanding, or failed to distance themselves from the emerging fascist   [ 16 ]   After War the BGB contributed to the establishment of the characteristic Swiss post-war consensual politics, social agreements and economic growth policies. The party continued to be a reliable political partner with the Conservative People's and the Free Democratic   [ 17 ]     years   [  edit  ]   1971, the BGB changed its name to the Swiss People's Party (SVP) after it merged with the from Glarus and Graubünden .   [ 18 ]   The Democratic Party had been supported particularly by workers, and the SVP sought to expand its electoral base towards these, as the traditional BGB base in the rural population had started to lose its importance in the post-war era. As the Democratic Party had represented centrist social-liberal positions, the course of the SVP shifted towards the political centre following internal   [ 19 ]   The new party however continued to see its level of support at around 11%, the same as the former BGB throughout the post-war era. Internal debates continued, and the 1980s saw growing conflicts between the Bern and Zürich cantonal branches, where the former branch represented the centrist faction, and the latter looked to put new issues on the political   [ 19 ]    the young entrepreneur was elected president of the Zürich SVP in 1977, he declared his intent to oversee significant change in the political line of the Zürich SVP, bringing an end to debates that aimed to open the party up to a wide array of opinions. Blocher soon consolidated his power in Zürich, and began to renew the organisational structures, activities, campaigning style and political agenda of the local   [ 20 ]   The young members of the party was boosted with the establishment of a cantonal (JSVP) in 1977, as well as political training courses. The ideology of the Zürich branch was also reinforced, and the rhetoric hardened, which resulted in the best election result for the Zürich branch in fifty years in the federal with an increase from 11.3% to 14.5%. This was contrasted with the stable level in the other cantons, although the support also stagnated in Zürich through the   [ 21 ]     of the new SVP   [  edit  ]   struggle between the SVP's largest branches of Bern and Zürich continued into the early 1990s. While the Bern-oriented faction represented the old moderate style, the Zürich-oriented wing led by Christoph Blocher represented a new radical agenda. The Zürich wing began to politicise asylum issues, and the question of started to dominate Swiss political debates. They also adopted more confrontational   [ 22 ]   The Zürich-wing followingly started to gain ground in the party at the expense of the Bern-wing, and the party became increasingly centralised as a national party, in contrast to the traditional Swiss system of parties with loose organisational structures and weak central   [ 23 ]   During the 1990s, the party also doubled its number of cantonal branches (to eventually be represented in all cantons), which strengthened the power of the Zürich-wing since most new sections supported their   [ 24 ]    1991, the party for the first time became the strongest party in Zürich, with 20.2% of the   [ 25 ]   The party broke through in the early 1990s in both Zürich and Switzerland as a whole, and experienced dramatically increasing results in   [ 26 ]   From being the smallest of the four governing parties at the start of the 1990s, the party by the end of the decade emerged as the strongest party in   [ 27 ]   At the same time, the party expanded its electoral base towards new voter   [ 28 ]   The SVP in general won its best results in cantons where the cantonal branches adopted the agenda of the Zürich   [ 29 ]   In the federal the SVP for the first time became the strongest party in Switzerland with 22.5% of the vote, a 12.6% share increase. This was the biggest increase of votes for any party in the entire history of the Swiss proportional electoral system, which was introduced in   [ 30 ]    a result of the remarkable increase in the SVP's popularity, the party gained a second ministerial position in the in 2003, which was taken by Christoph Blocher. Before this, the only SVP Federal Councillor had always been from the moderate Bern   [ ]      [ 31 ]   The federal still confirmed the SVP as the strongest party in Switzerland with 28.9% of the vote and 62 seats in the National Council, the largest share of the vote for any single party ever in   [ 32 ]   However, the Federal Council refused to re-elect Blocher, who was replaced by of the moderate Graubünden   [ 32 ]      [ 33 ]      [ 12 ]   In response, the national SVP withdrew its support from Widmer-Schlumpf and its other Federal Councillor, fellow SVP moderate from the party, along with Widmer-Schlumpf's whole cantonal   [ 32 ]      [ 34 ]   The SVP thus formed the first opposition group in Switzerland since the   [ 32 ]    2008, the SVP demanded that Widmer-Schlumpf resign from the Federal Council and leave the party. When she refused, the SVP demanded that its Grisons branch expel her. Since Swiss parties are legally federations of cantonal parties, the federal SVP could not expel her itself. The Grisons branch stood by Widmer-Schlumpf, leading the SVP to expel it from the party. Shortly afterward, the Grisons branch reorganised itself as the Democratic (BDP). Soon afterward, virtually all of the SVP's Bern branch, including Schmid, defected to the new   [ 34 ]      [ 35 ]   The SVP regained its position in government in late 2008, when Schmid was forced to resign due to a political scandal, and was replaced with .

This loss could be partly attributed to the split of the BDP, which gained 5.4% of the vote in 2011. However the SVP rebounded strongly in the federal gathering a record 29.4% of the national vote and 65 seats in   [ 37 ]   Media attributed the rise to concerns over the migrant .

This stance is most evident in the rejection of an accession of to the European the rejection of military involvement abroad, and the rejection of increases in government spending on social welfare and emphasis of the party's policies lie in foreign policy, immigration and homeland security policy as well as tax and social welfare policy. Among political opponents, the SVP has gained a reputation as a party that maintains a hard-line    [  edit  ]   its foreign policy the SVP opposes increased involvement of Switzerland in intergovernmental and especially including the UN EEA EU Schengen and Dublin treaties, and closer ties with NATO The party stands for a strict neutrality of the country and the preservation of the strong role of the as the institution responsible for national defense.

The SVP warns of immigration into the social welfare system and criticises the high proportion of foreigners among the benefit recipients and other social welfare programs. According to the opinion of the party, such benefits amount to waste of taxpayers' money. Numerous SVP members have shown themselves to be of by having participated in the during which they pushed for an initiative to ban the construction of minarets. In November 2009 this ban won the majority vote (57.5%) and became an amendment to the Swiss Constitution. However, the four existing minarets are not affected by the new legislation. Other recent victories of the SVP in regards to immigration policy include the federal popular initiatives the expulsion of criminal (52.3%), and mass (50.3%) in 2010 and 2014 key concern of the SVP is what it alleges is an increasing influence of the judiciary on politics. According to the SVP, this influence, especially through increasingly puts the Swiss in question. Public law which is legitimate by standards should be agreed upon by the federal court. The international law, which according to the SVP is not democratically legitimate, shall always be subordinate to the Swiss law. The SVP also criticises the judiciary as undemocratic because the courts have made decisions against the will of the majority. Therefore, the SVP promotes the preservation of voting procedures in the question of the naturalization of foreigners even after a federal court ruling deemed such procedures as unconstitutional. According to the SVP, the racism penalty and anti-racism commission should be abolished in the interest of of .
