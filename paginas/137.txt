These then sent members to the annual General People's Congress, which was broadcast live on television. In principle, the People's Congresses were Libya's highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or with Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the People's   [ 140 ]          Flag of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab remained limited, and major decisions regarding the economy and defence were avoided or dealt with cursorily; the GPC largely remained "a rubber stamp" for Gaddafi's   [ 141 ]   On rare occasions, the GPC opposed Gaddafi's suggestions, sometimes successfully; notably, when Gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished, believing that was healthier for children, the GPC rejected the   [ 141 ]   In other instances, Gaddafi pushed through laws without the GPC's support, such as when he desired to allow women into the armed   [ 142 ]   Gaddafi proclaimed that the People's Congresses provided for Libya's every political need, rendering other political organizations unnecessary; all non-authorized groups, including political parties, professional associations, independent trade unions and women's groups, were   [ 143 ]    preceding legal institutions abolished, Gaddafi envisioned the Jamahiriya as following the Qur'an for legal guidance, adopting sharia law; he proclaimed "man-made" laws unnatural and dictatorial, only permitting Allah   [ 144 ]   Within a year he was backtracking, announcing that sharia was inappropriate for the Jamahiriya because it guaranteed the protection of private property, contravening Green   [ 145 ]   His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur'an led conservative clerics to accuse him of  shirk  furthering their opposition to his   [ 110 ]   In July, a war broke with Egypt, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority.

Private enterprise was virtually eliminated, largely replaced by a centrally controlled  Libyan Studies scholar Ronald St   [ 148 ]     December 1978, Gaddafi stepped down as Secretary-General of the GPC, announcing his new focus on revolutionary rather than governmental activities; this was part of his new emphasis on separating the apparatus of the revolution from the government.

In March 1978, the government issued guidelines for housing redistribution, attempting to ensure the population that every adult Libyan owned his own home and that nobody was enslaved to paying their rent. Most families were banned from owning more than one house, while former rental properties were seized and sold to the tenants at a heavily subsidized   [ 151 ]   In September, Gaddafi called for the People's Committees to eliminate the "bureaucracy of the public sector" and the "dictatorship of the private sector"; the People's Committees took control of several hundred companies, converting them into run by elected   [ 152 ]    2 March 1979, the GPC announced the separation of government and revolution, the latter being represented by new Revolutionary Committees, who operated in tandem with the People's Committees in schools, universities, unions, the police force and the   [ 153 ]   Dominated by revolutionary zealots, the Revolutionary Committees were led by and a Central Coordinating Office, and met with Gaddafi   [ 153 ]   Publishing a weekly magazine Green in October 1980 they took control of the press.

Not an imaginary one that people write about in books, but a concrete  Muammar   [ 158 ]     Jamahiriya' radical direction earned the government many enemies. In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him, and began to increasingly entrust security to his Qaddadfa   [ 159 ]   Many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against the administration, and a number of western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles. Most prominent was the Front for the Salvation of (NFSL), founded in 1981 by which orchestrated militant attacks against Libya's   [ 160 ]   while another, al-Borkan, began killing Libyan diplomats   [ 161 ]   Following Gaddafi's command to kill these "stray dogs", under Colonel leadership, the Revolutionary Committees set up overseas branches to suppress counter-revolutionary activity, assassinating various   [ 162 ]   Although nearby nations like Syria also used hit squads, Gaddafi was unusual in publicly bragging about his administration's use of them; in June 1980, he ordered all dissidents to return home or be "liquidated wherever you   [ 163 ]    1979, the U.S. placed Libya on its list of Sponsors of ",   [ 164 ]   while at the end of the year demonstration torched the U.S. in Tripoli in solidarity with the perpetrators of the hostage .

In 1980, they proposed a political union, with Libya paying off Syria's £1 billion debt to the Soviet Union; although pressures led Assad to pull out, they remained   [ 167 ]   Another key ally was Uganda, and in 1979, Gaddafi sent 2,500 troops into to defend the of President from Tanzanian invaders. The mission failed; 400 Libyans were killed and they were forced to   [ 168 ]   Gaddafi later came to regret his alliance with Amin, openly criticising   [ 169 ]     with the US and its allies:  early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4   [ 170 ]   Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on "Gaddafi's Pet Project", the Man-Made although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st   [ 171 ]   Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut   [ 172 ]   Libya had long supported the FROLINAT militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the Frolinat-controlled to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The of African (OAU) rejected this, and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian   [ 173 ]   Many African nations had tired of Libya's policies of interference in foreign affairs; by 1980, nine African states had cut off diplomatic relations with   [ 174 ]   while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli in order to prevent Gaddafi gaining   [ 175 ]   Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch signed the Oujda Treaty, forming the Arab-African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the U.S. and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the   [ 176 ]   Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his home was unsuccessfully attacked by a joint NFSL–Muslim Brotherhood militia, and in the aftermath 5000 dissidents were   [ 177 ]          13th Anniversary of the 1 September Revolution on postage stamp, Libya 1981, the new US President pursued a hard line approach to Libya, erroneously considering it a of the Soviet   [ 178 ]   In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the .

In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the "Revolution within a Revolution", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small   [ 196 ]   Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticised   [ 197 ]   asserting that "they deviated, harmed, tortured" and that "the true revolutionary does not practise   [ 198 ]   In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in   [ 199 ]   In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained   [ 200 ]   Also in 1989, the government founded the International Prize for Human to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist .
