An all-rounder he played for County Cricket between 1911 and 1927. In all he scored 14,707 runs at an average of 30.01 and took 1,003 wickets at an average of 18.45. Kilner scored 1,000 runs in a season ten times and took 100 wickets in a season five times. On four occasions, he completed the double scoring 1,000 runs and taking 100 wickets in the same season, recognised as a sign of a quality first played for Yorkshire as a batsman before the First World War, establishing a regular place in the side. After being wounded in the war, he returned in 1919 to a Yorkshire side which was short of bowlers As a result, Kilner began to practise his bowling to the point where he became highly regarded as a left-arm His aggressive batting and warm personality made him a popular player with both cricketers and spectators. His form brought selection by England in 1924 and a visit to Australia for the tour of Although the second most successful bowler of the tour, his bowling subsequently declined in effectiveness, and did not trouble batsmen on good pitches. He was selected during the 1926 Ashes but dropped for the final Test. Kilner went on several coaching trips to India during English winters, and on one of these, in 1928, he contracted an illness; on his return to England, he died aged 37.

[ 3 ]   The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the boys were members of the Lads' .   [ 3 ]   His father and his uncle, the former Yorkshire player, encouraged him to play cricket from an early age. He showed enough ability to join the local colliery team, Mitchell   [ 3 ]    the age of 14 in 1904, Kilner reached the Mitchell Main first   [ 3 ]   Although selected regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently his His bowling was more effective but used   [ 4 ]   By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of   [ 5 ]     years at   [  edit  ]    for   [  edit  ]   scoring a second century for Mitchell Main at the start of the 1910 season, Kilner was chosen to play for Yorkshire Second XI. In his first season, he took three wickets and had a of 12.50 but continued to do well for Mitchell   [ 6 ]   For 1911, Yorkshire sent Kilner to play for Harrogate Cricket Club which provided a higher standard of cricket than Mitchell Main: the county had a system whereby promising young players were sent to gain experience in competitive matches for local   [ 7 ]   Kilner began to record good batting and bowling performances. Although his form for Yorkshire Second XI was more inconsistent, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire that season against Somerset in the He scored 0 and 14 and did not   [ 8 ]   In a further six matches for Yorkshire in 1911, his highest innings was 18 runs his average with the bat was just 6.66 in ten innings and he did not take any   [ 9 ]      [ 10 ]   For Harrogate, he was more successful, with 519 runs and 28   [ 11 ]       [  edit  ]   made a good start to 1912 for Yorkshire Second XI, scoring centuries in two consecutive games; in the second he also took twelve wickets for 75   [ 12 ]   These performances, coupled with continued good form for Harrogate, led to Kilner's recall to the Yorkshire first team in June. He replaced the injured all-rounder for a match against Nottinghamshire .   [ 13 ]   On the first morning, Kilner was used as the sixth bowler and proved successful; he finished with four wickets for 66 runs. Although failing to score in the first innings, he came in to bat in the second innings with Yorkshire 133 for four, needing 249 for victory. He shared a partnership of 113 for the fifth wicket and scored 83 to take Yorkshire to a five wicket   [ 12 ]      [ 14 ]   This performance kept Kilner in the team for the remainder of the season, even after Hirst's return. He played 23 times for   [ 9 ]      [ 15 ]   He scored 570 runs at an average of 22.80 and took 16 wickets at an average of 22.12, figures regarded as respectable for a first full season.

In his years there, he scored 967 runs, averaging 38.68, and took 71 wickets at an average of less than ten runs per   [ 15 ]    the 1913 season, Kilner scored 1,586 runs at an average of 34.47, which remained his highest seasonal aggregate of runs and placed him third in the Yorkshire batting   [ 9 ]      [ 16 ]   He also took 18 wickets at   [ 10 ]   At the end of May and beginning of June, Kilner took part in century partnerships in four consecutive matches, culminating in his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire .

His batting was always adventurous and attacking although he often made uncertain starts to his innings and showed impatience. The strength and variety of the Yorkshire bowling attack meant his left-arm spin was not often   [ 19 ]   Even so, Yorkshire dropped to second in the   [ 20 ]    illness during the winter of 1913–14 took its toll on Kilner at the start of the 1914   [ 21 ]   He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his uncertain form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting   [ 9 ]      [ 22 ]      [ 23 ]   His bowling was rarely used and he took just one   [ 10 ]      [ 22 ]   Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28   [ 24 ]   Yorkshire fell to fourth in the   [ 20 ]     World   [  edit  ]   United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, while Kilner was playing in that season's at .   [ 25 ]   Initially the government requested that cricket should continue, though several cricketers with military obligations, including Yorkshire's captain, Archibald were called up immediately. As the fighting started, and casualties began to mount, public opinion turned against the continuation of the season, and Yorkshire's match against Sussex at Hove, which concluded on 1 September, was the last County Championship match until 1919. The newspaper Cricket reported "The men's hearts were barely in the game, and the match was given up as a draw at   [ 26 ]      [ 27 ]   With the suspension of the championship, Kilner and Major Booth enlisted in the army together, joining the and Bradford in the Yorkshire .

The team won promotion from the in 1915, and took their place in the when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is unclear how often he represented the   [ 28 ]      [ 33 ]     career after the   [  edit  ]    batsman to   [  edit  ]   cricket resumed after the war in 1919 County Championship matches were reduced from three days to two in a one-season experiment. Following the deaths of Booth in the war and from illness, as well as the decline in the bowling of the aging George Hirst, Yorkshire lacked an effective attack. Subsequently, Kilner was asked to deliver more overs, although not to the extent of a main   [ 31 ]      [ 34 ]   He took 45 wickets, more than his entire first-class wicket aggregate before the war, at an average of 18.12.

He scored 1,198 runs at 27.22 and scored two   [ 9 ]   This meant he completed the double as the sign of a quality all-round cricketer—for the first   [ 51 ]   Kilner was fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages and fourth in the bowling   [ 52 ]      [ 53 ]   At the end of the season, he was again selected for CI Thornton's XI, as well as in two games at   [ 17 ]   Over the English winter, Kilner accepted a job coaching for the of in India. He played in several first-class   [ 17 ]      [ 51 ]   and enjoyed himself enough to return the following   [ 51 ]    Kilner's peak as a bowler came in the when he took 158 wickets at an average of 12.90 and finished second in the Yorkshire   [ 10 ]      [ 54 ]   With the bat, he failed to score a hundred for the first time since   [ 55 ]   but still made 1,401 runs at 34.17 and including nine scores over   [ 9 ]   This placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages, his contributions helping his team to retain the County   [ 55 ]   He made a very effective start to the season, taking 27 wickets in the first four matches for just 157   [ 56 ]      [ 57 ]   including the best figures of his career, eight for 26 against Glamorgan ,   [ 58 ]   and six for 14 against Middlesex .   [ 59 ]   Later that season against Surrey he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling   [ 31 ]   Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two. After took a wicket, Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match-winning performance. He finished with bowling figures of six for 22 and took ten wickets in the match. He had been under the impression that Surrey had only needed seven runs (rather than the 27 they required) to win at the end, and his team-mates remembered he was pale with effort and   [ 31 ]      [ 57 ]      [ 60 ]   In the same season, Kilner was picked for the v match at Cricket the most prestigious such fixture at the time, where he scored eight in his only innings and took three   [ 55 ]      [ 61 ]   Wisden commented that he seemed certain to be picked for the England side shortly (there were no Tests played that   [ 31 ]   He took a step towards this when he was selected for a Test trial match, scoring 26 and 11 not out, but only bowling 18 overs in the match to take two wickets.

[ 63 ]   His batting suffered a decline; he scored 731 runs at 20.88, the lowest aggregate of his career and his first sub-1,000 total since   [ 9 ]   Kilner took 33 wickets in the first six matches of the season, and his form earned selection for a Test trial   [ 61 ]      [ 64 ]   In this game, he took three for 49 in the first innings and a further wicket in the second but only scored 20 runs in two innings. After 19 wickets in his next three matches, including seven in the match against the South African touring side, he was awarded a place in the England team for the first   [ 61 ]   In his maiden Test, he scored 59 out of a large total, batting at number seven. South Africa were dismissed for 30 runs in the first innings before Kilner had an opportunity to   [ 65 ]   In the second innings, he delivered 22 overs without taking a wicket and commentators were not impressed by his bowling. The selectors left Kilner out of the next two Tests, all-rounder W. taking his   [ 64 ]      [ 66 ]      [ 67 ]   but he played in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. He scored a rapid 113—his only century of the season—for the Players. By lunch on the last day, the Gentlemen had followed-on but were well placed to secure a draw with the score at 112 for three. Kilner settled the match by taking quick wickets and ending the innings with figures of six for 20 as the Players won by an   [ 68 ]      [ 69 ]   Kilner was recalled for Hearne in the fourth Test, but rain prevented all play after the first day. He bowled 12 wicketless   [ 70 ]   meaning he had not dismissed anyone in his first two Tests and he did not play in the last Test as Hearne   [ 71 ]   For Yorkshire, he had a more successful time, three times taking ten wickets in a match, including twelve for 55 in the final championship match of the season, which Yorkshire had to win to have a chance of winning the title. Yorkshire's opponents, Sussex were bowled out twice for less than   [ 72 ]   and when other results went Yorkshire's way, the club were crowned champions for the third successive   [ 63 ]   Kilner was chosen for the Players again in an end of season match at   [ 17 ]   Although his poor batting meant his form as an all-rounder was disappointing, he had a very good season as a bowler.

Kilner passed fifty runs just once after his century and with the ball took one wicket in 81 overs during seven   [ 61 ]      [ 63 ]   He did not play in the first two Test matches, both of which were lost by   [ 63 ]   but was selected for the third when the selectors altered the bowling attack. During the match, a series of injuries to colleagues left Kilner with a heavy workload. Australia batted first and scored 489, a total which looked unlikely when they lost three wickets for 22 and later six wickets for 119. England's pace bowlers, Gilligan and had to leave the field injured, allowing Australia to recover; later the spinner hurt his wrist and could not   [ 74 ]   The only fit front-line bowlers remaining were Kilner and .

Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in the first few days of April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from in the presence of his   [ 90 ]      [ 108 ]    town of Wombwell expressed enormous sympathy and tributes came from around the world. When Kilner's funeral took place on 10 April, the streets were packed with mourners. Many came from outside the town, and according to contemporary estimates 100,000 people were present to pay tribute to Kilner; there may have been   [ 109 ]   Over a thousand people were at the cemetery for the burial, and Yorkshire cricketers carried the   [ 110 ]   Two years later, the team which toured England in visited Kilner's grave in Wombwell to lay a   [ 111 ]   The rector at the funeral said in his tribute: "A Yorkshire wicket has fallen and one of Yorkshire's best men is out; and we lament his loss; not merely because it is the loss of a great cricketer, but because it is the loss of such a cricketer as Roy Kilner   [ 109 ]     and   [  edit  ]         Kilner batting in the fifth Test at Sydney, first came into the Yorkshire side as a batsman. He was considered a good, reliable batsman when he began, although his style was regarded by Yorkshire critics as unorthodox to the point where they disapproved of some of his unusual, eccentric   [ 112 ]   For Yorkshire, he appeared high in the order but batted between number seven and number nine for   [ 84 ]      [ 113 ]   If the circumstances of the game demanded it, he was able to play slowly and defensively and restrain his naturally aggressive style. He was particularly effective while playing the drive and For most of his career, his effectiveness as a batsman was not compromised by his improvement and increasing workload as a   [ 90 ]      [ 114 ]    terms of bowling, Kilner was an effective performer on rain affected   [ 112 ]   His accuracy also enabled him to bowl on good pitches without the batsmen being able to score too many   [ 90 ]   In 1923, journalist said Kilner spun the ball more than any other English bowler. He noted, as did Wisden how Kilner often bowled the meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets, unusual for a left-arm spinner in this   [ 31 ]      [ 55 ]   This established a contrast with his fellow left-arm spinner, Wilfred Rhodes, and increased their effectiveness. Furthermore, it allowed him to surprise batsmen with a different delivery, such as one did not .

Few modern professionals commanded such a measure of esteem and kindly regard from his own immediate colleagues and his opponents in the cricket field as did Roy   [ 114 ]    was a favourite of cricket writer who attributed several sayings to him in his prose.
