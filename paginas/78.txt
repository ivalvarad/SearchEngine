With the Dutch achieving political domination throughout Java for the first time in   [ 39 ]   it was possible to introduce an agricultural policy of government-controlled forced cultivation. Termed cultuurstelsel (cultivation system) in Dutch and (forced plantation) in Indonesian, farmers were required to deliver, as a form of tax, fixed amounts of specified crops, such as sugar or   [ 40 ]   Much of Java became a Dutch plantation and revenue rose continually through the 19th century which were reinvested into the Netherlands to save it from   [ 13 ]      [ 40 ]   Between 1830 and 1870, 1 billion guilders were taken from Indonesia, on average making 25 per cent of the annual Dutch Government   [ 41 ]   The Cultivation System, however, brought much economic hardship to Javanese peasants, who suffered famine and epidemics in the   [ 13 ]          Map of the Dutch East Indies in public opinion in the Netherlands led to much of the Cultivation System's excesses being eliminated under the agrarian reforms of the "Liberal Period". Dutch private capital flowed in after 1850, especially in tin mining and plantation estate agriculture. The Billiton Company's tin mines off the eastern Sumatra coast was financed by a syndicate of Dutch entrepreneurs, including the younger brother of King William III. Mining began in 1860.

[ 42 ]   From 1870, the Indies were opened up to private enterprise and Dutch businessmen set up large, profitable plantations. Sugar production doubled between 1870 and 1885; new crops such as tea and cinchona flourished, and rubber was introduced, leading to dramatic increases in Dutch profits. Changes were not limited to Java, or agriculture; oil from Sumatra and Kalimantan became a valuable resource for industrialising Europe. Dutch commercial interests expanded off Java to the outer islands with increasingly more territory coming under direct Dutch control or dominance in the latter half of the 19th   [ 13 ]   However, the resulting scarcity of land for rice production, combined with dramatically increasing populations, especially in Java, led to further   [ 13 ]          Different flags in Dutch East colonial exploitation of Indonesia's wealth contributed to the industrialisation of the Netherlands, while simultaneously laying the foundation for the industrialisation of Indonesia. The Dutch introduced coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco and rubber and large expanses of Java became plantations cultivated by Javanese peasants, collected by Chinese intermediaries, and sold on overseas markets by European   [ 13 ]   In the late 19th century economic growth was based on heavy world demand for tea, coffee, and cinchona. The government invested heavily in a railroad network (150 miles long in 1873, 1,200 in 1900), as well as telegraph lines, and entrepreneurs opened banks, shops and newspapers. The Dutch East Indies produced most of the world's supply of quinine and pepper, over a third of its rubber, a quarter of its coconut products, and a fifth of its tea, sugar, coffee, and oil. The profit from the Dutch East Indies made the Netherlands one of the world's most significant colonial   [ 13 ]   The shipping line supported the unification of the colonial economy and brought inter-island shipping through to Batavia, rather than through Singapore, thus focussing more economic activity on   [ 43 ]    worldwide recession of the late 1880s and early 1890s saw the commodity prices on which the colony depended collapse.

By 1900, foreign-held assets in the Netherlands Indies totalled about 750 million guilders ($300 million), mostly in   [ 46 ]    1900 upgrading the infrastructure of ports and roads was a high priority for the Dutch, with the goal of modernising the economy, facilitating commerce, and speeding up military movements. By 1950 Dutch engineers had built and upgraded a road network with 12,000km of asphalted surface, 41,000km of metalled road area and 16,000km of gravel   [ 47 ]   In addition the Dutch built, 7,500 kilometres (4,700mi) of railways, bridges, irrigation systems covering 1.4 million hectares (5,400 sq mi) of rice fields, several harbours, and 140 public drinking water systems.

Ordinary Indonesians were educated in Malay in Roman alphabet with "link" schools preparing bright Indonesian students for entry into the Dutch-language   [ 57 ]   Vocational schools and programs were set up by the Indies government to train indigenous Indonesians for specific roles in the colonial economy. Chinese and Arabs, officially termed "foreign orientals", could not enrol in either the vocational schools or primary   [ 58 ]    of Dutch schools opened their own schools modelled on the Dutch school system, as did Christian missionaries, Theosophical Societies, and Indonesian cultural associations.

In 1898 the Dutch East Indies government established a school to train named tot Opleiding van Inlandsche (STOVIA).

In 1927, STOVIA's status was changed to that of a full tertiary-level institution and its name was changed to (GHS). The GHS occupied the same main building and used the same teaching hospital as the current Faculty of Medicine of of The old links between the Netherlands and Indonesia are still clearly visible in such technological areas as irrigation design.
