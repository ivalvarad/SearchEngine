The player-character, Chell is challenged by an named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Operating to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows momentum to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game   many of the team members from the Institute of who worked on were hired by Valve for the creation of Portal .  Portal was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite being considered short in length. The game received praise for its unique gameplay and darkly humorous story. It received acclaim for the character of GLaDOS, voiced by in the English-language version, and the end credits song written by for the game. Not counting sales through Steam, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release. The game's popularity has led to official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A sequel,   was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer   [ 12 ]     Contents   1 Gameplay     2 Synopsis    2.1 Characters     2.2 Setting     2.3 Plot     3 Development    3.1 Concept     3.2 Design     3.3 Soundtrack     3.4 Merchandise     3.5 Distribution    3.5.1 Demo     3.5.2  Portal      3.5.3  Still      3.5.4 Mods     3.6 Sequel     3.7     4    4.1 Awards     5 References     6     Gameplay   [  edit  ]       representation of how the magnitude of) is conserved through portals. By jumping into the blue portal, the character is launched out of the orange portal and onto the platform on the     more advanced portal technique. The character builds up speed using two blue portals, to reach an otherwise unreachable area. The second blue portal is carefully created in mid-air, after exiting the orange portal for the first time, destroying the first blue portal in the Portal the player controls the protagonist, Chell from a as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum   [ 13 ]   As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance   [ 14 ]   For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by   [ 13 ]   As GLaDOS puts it, "In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out." If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields known as emancipation grills, occasionally called "fizzlers" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. The fields also block attempts to fire portals through   [ 15 ]    Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from   [ 13 ]   she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single  GameSpot noted, in its initial review of Portal that many solutions exist for completing each puzzle, and that the gameplay "gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy things that you can   [ 16 ]   Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber. Challenge maps are unlocked near the halfway point and Advanced Chambers are unlocked when the game is   [ 17 ]   In Challenge mode, levels are revisited with the added goal of completing the test chamber either with as little time, with the least number of portals, or with the fewest footsteps possible. In Advanced mode, certain levels are made more complex with the addition of more obstacles and   [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]      Synopsis   [  edit  ]    Characters   [  edit  ]   game features two characters: the player-controlled named Chell and GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Operating a computer that monitors and directs the player. In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell is given by GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the "Lab Rat" comic created by Valve to bridge the gap between Portal and   Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having "too much tenacity"—the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test   [ 20 ]      [ 21 ]     Setting   [  edit  ]            The logo for Aperture Science  Portal takes place in the Science Laboratories computer aided enrichment Science in short—which is a research corporation responsible for the creation of the portal gun. According to information presented in the location of the complex is in the Peninsula of Information about the company, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional   [ 22 ]   According to the Aperture Science Web site, founded the company in 1943 for the sole purpose of making for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from "moon rock poisoning" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier and plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children's parents to adults who are in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier, a man-sized ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space with possible applications as a shower curtain, it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research. The development of GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk-operating system, began in 1986 in response to work on similar portal   [ 23 ]   A presentation seen during gameplay reveals that GLaDOS was also included in a proposed bid for de-icing fuel lines, incorporated as a fully functional disk-operation system that is arguably alive, unlike Black Mesa's proposal, which inhibits ice, nothing   [ 24 ]   Roughly thirteen years later, work on GLaDOS was completed and the untested AI was activated during the company's first ever in May   [ 22 ]   Immediately after activation, the facility was flooded with deadly neurotoxin by the AI. Events of the first  Half-Life  game occur shortly thereafter, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of affirmed that the Combine invasion, chronologically taking place between Half-Life and   occurred during Portal   [ 25 ]    areas of the Enrichment Center that Chell explores suggest that it is part of a massive research installation. At the time of events depicted in Portal the facility seems to be long-deserted, although most of its equipment remains operational without human   [ 26 ]   Aperture Science exists in the  Half-Life  universe. During its development,  2: Episode  featured a chapter set on Aperture Science's icebreaker ship Borealis but this was abandoned and removed before   [ 27 ]     Plot   [  edit  ]    Portal plot is revealed to the player via audio messages from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels. According to Final Hours of Portal the year is established to be "somewhere in 2010"—twelve years after its abandonment. The game begins with protagonist Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS about the upcoming test experience. This part of the game involves distinct test chambers that, in sequence, introduce players to the game's mechanics. GLaDOS's announcements serve not only to instruct Chell and help her progress through the game, but also to create atmosphere and develop the AI as a   [ 13 ]   Chell is promised cake and as her reward if she manages to complete all the test   [ 28 ]    proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, interacting only with GLaDOS. Over the course of the game, GLaDOS's motives are hinted to be more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests. Although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids as a result of "mandatory scheduled maintenance" in the regular test chamber, as well as having test chambers flooded with deadly liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it "unfortunately must be euthanized in an "emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can   [ 26 ]   Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being disabled ("I don't blame you" and "No hard   [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]    Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her "victory candescence", maneuvering Chell into a pit of fire. As GLaDOS assures her that "all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees  sic  kelvin Chell escapes with the use of the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment   [ 31 ]   GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the "party escort submission position", lying face-first on the ground, so that a "party associate" can take her to her reward. Chell continues forward. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she has become corrupt and may have killed everyone else in the center. Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as "the cake is a lie" and pastiches of poem "The Chariot", Wadsworth "The Reaper and the Flowers", and "No Coward Soul Is Mine", mourning the death of the Companion   [ 13 ]    attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming that she is going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange one of GLaDOS' personality core spheres falls off; Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core, which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin, and goes on to state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more pieces of GLaDOS, while GLaDOS attempts to discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After she has destroyed the final piece, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before announcement; in this Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the "party escort submission   [ 24 ]      [ 32 ]    final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Forest ,   [ 33 ]   and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. One by one a number of the cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, plunging the room into   [ 34 ]   As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still   [ 35 ]     Development   [  edit  ]    Concept   [  edit  ]    Portal is Valve's to the freeware game   the 2005 independent game released by students of the Institute of the original team is now employed at   [ 36 ]      [ 37 ]   Valve became interested in after seeing the game at DigiPen's annual career fair; Robin Walker, one of Valve's developers, saw the game at the fair and later contacted the team providing them with advice and offering to show their game at Valve's offices. After their presentation, Valve's president quickly offered the entire team jobs at Valve to develop the game   [ 38 ]   Newell later commented that he was impressed with the DigiPen team as "they had actually carried the concept through", already having included the interaction between portals and physics, completing most of the work that Valve would have had to commit on their   [ 38 ]   Certain elements have been retained from such as the system of identifying the two unique portal endpoints with the colors orange and blue. A key difference in the signature portal mechanic between the two games however is that Portal portal gun cannot create a portal through an existing portal unlike in The game's original setting, of a princess trying to escape a dungeon, was dropped in favor of the Aperture Science   [ 38 ]   Portal took approximately two years and four months to complete after the DigiPen team was brought into   [ 39 ]   and no more than ten people were involved with its   [ 40 ]   Portal writer who, along with fellow writer Chet Faliszek, was hired by Valve for the game, claimed that "Without the constraints, Portal would not be as good a   [ 41 ]    Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer on fitting the game into the series'   [ 42 ]   This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal they decided to tie the game to an existing Half-Life allow them to reuse the art   [ 24 ]   Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal .   [ 37 ]   The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing   [ 24 ]   They drafted early lines for the yet-named "polite" AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS   [ 24 ]   GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these   [ 43 ]   Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as "at the beginning of the Portal development process, we sat down as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a lot of people like   [ 24 ]      [ 43 ]   The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by .

The clean, spartan look to the chambers was influenced by the film   . austere settings in the game came about because testers spent too much time trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film   as   [ 45 ]   While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include   [ 45 ]   They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the   [ 46 ]   though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and story   [ 20 ]      [ 21 ]   According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by Bond which was partially applied to the turrets, where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, "Time pressure makes people think something is a lot more complicated than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, "It was really cheap to make [the neurotoxin gas]" in order to simplify the dialogue during the   [ 40 ]    face and body are modeled after an American freelance actress and voice-over artist, selected by Valve from a local modeling agency for her face and body   [ 39 ]      [ 47 ]   Ellen McLain provided the voice of the antagonist GLaDOS. Erik Wolpaw noted, "When we were still fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final   [ 43 ]   performed the growling and snarling voice of GLaDOS's final personality core, named the Anger Weighted Companion Cube inspiration was from project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some "declassified government interrogation thing" whereby "isolation leads subjects to begin to attach to inanimate   [ 40 ]      [ 43 ]   Swift commented, "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them from the beginning to the end. But people would forget about the box, so we added dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, we added the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the   [ 45 ]   Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came as a result of the final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative "way stronger" with its   [ 48 ]   Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the or  A Space  are   [ 45 ]    portal gun's full name, Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, can be abbreviated as ASHPD, which resembles a shortening of the name Adrian Shephard, the protagonist of  Opposing  This similarity was noticed by fans before the game's release; as a result, the team placed a in the game by having the letters of Adrian Shephard highlighted on keyboards found within the   [ 45 ]   According to Kim Swift, the cake is a Black Forest cake that she thought looked the best at the nearby Regent Bakery and Café in Redmond Washington, and, as an Easter egg within the game, its recipe is scattered among various screens showing lines of binary   [ 33 ]      [ 49 ]   The Regent Bakery has stated that since the release of the game, its Black Forest cake has been one of its more popular   [ 49 ]     Soundtrack   [  edit  ]   of the game's soundtrack is non-lyrical composed by and somewhat dark and mysterious to match the mood of the environments. The closing credits song, was written by and sung by Ellen McLain (a classically trained operatic soprano as the GLaDOS character. A brief instrumental version of Still Alive is played in an uptempo Latin style over radios in-game. Wolpaw notes that Coulton was invited to Valve a year before the release of Portal though it was not yet clear where Coulton would contribute. "Once Kim [Swift] and I met with him, it quickly became apparent that he had the perfect sensibility to write a song for   [ 35 ]      [ 43 ]   The use of the song over the closing credits was based on a similar concept from the game   one of Wolpaw's favorite   [ 50 ]   The song was released as a free downloadable song for the video   on April 1,   [ 51 ]      [ 52 ]      [ 53 ]   The soundtrack for Portal was released as a part of  Orange Box Original     [ 54 ]   and includes both GLaDOS's in-game rendition and Coulton's vocal mix of "Still  Portal soundtrack was released as part of a four-disc retail release, 2: Songs To Test By (Collector's on October 30, 2012, featuring music from both   [ 55 ]   The game's soundtrack became available via Steam Music on September 24,   [ 56 ]     Merchandise   [  edit  ]         The popularity of the Weighted Companion Cube has led Valve to create merchandise based on it, including . popularity of the game and of its characters has led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store.
