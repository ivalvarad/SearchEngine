Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans. Migration is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the or the . migration has been recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by authors including Homer and Aristotle and in the of for species such as storks and swallows More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including and Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of tubenoses Procellariiformes such as albatrosses circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as migrate 14,000km (8,700mi) between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including on mountains such as the Andes and timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length.

Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather. Sometimes, journeys are not termed "true migration" because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area). Migration is marked by its annual   [ 8 ]   Non-migratory birds are said to be resident or sedentary. Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance   [ 9 ]      [ 10 ]    bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway. The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south. Of course, in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance   [ 11 ]    primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the   [ 12 ]   Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the   [ 13 ]    advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the noctule which preys on nocturnal passerine   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]      [ 16 ]   The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune   [ 11 ]    a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as "partial migration". Partial migration is very common in the southern continents; in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerine species are partially   [ 17 ]   In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude. The migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary, where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied. This is an example of .   [ 18 ]   Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations 'slide' more evenly north and south without reversing   [ 19 ]    a population, it is common for different ages and/or sexes to have different patterns of timing and distance. Female chaffinches in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males   [ 20 ]    migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front. Often, this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed flyways These routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines, sometimes rivers, and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water. The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often   [ 11 ]   A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration, where birds flying North tend to be further West, and flying South tend to shift if not most, birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, flying in flocks reduces the energy cost. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]   Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5km/h (3.1mph) faster in flocks than when they were flying   [ 11 ]          skeletons have been found high in the fly at varying altitudes during migration. An expedition to found skeletons of and at 5,000m (16,000ft) on the .   [ 23 ]   have been recorded by GPS flying at up to 6,540 metres (21,460ft) while crossing the Himalayas, at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude for any bird. Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated with any direct   [ 24 ]   Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing land, and the reverse pattern is seen in   [ 25 ]      [ 26 ]   However most bird migration is in the range of 150 to 600m (490 to 1,970ft). aviation records from the United States show most collisions occur below 600m (2,000ft) and almost none above 1,800m   [ 27 ]    migration is not limited to birds that can fly. Most species of penguin (Spheniscidae) migrate by swimming. These routes can cover over 1,000km (620mi). Blue grouse perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking. Emus in Australia have been observed to undertake long-distance movements on foot during   [ 11 ]       [  edit  ]   typical image of migration is of northern landbirds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species winter in the Temperate in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the migrates from subarctic and to the contiguous United   [ 28 ]   and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the northwestward to .   [ 29 ]   Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents. Some ducks, such as the garganey move completely or partially into the tropics. The pied also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds, but in reverse: a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters. Detours avoiding such barriers are observed: for example, migrating from the to the travel via the coast and the rather than directly across the and northern Scandinavia .   [ 30 ]       [  edit  ]          similar situation occurs with waders (called shorebirds in North America). Many species, such as dunlin    [ 31 ]   and ,   [ 32 ]   undertake long movements from their Arctic breeding grounds to warmer locations in the same hemisphere, but others such as travel longer distances to the tropics in the Southern   [ 33 ]    some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the of and .   [ 34 ]      [ 35 ]    have the longest known non-stop flight of any migrant, flying 11,000km from Alaska to their non-breeding   [ 36 ]   Prior to migration, 55 percent of their bodyweight is stored as fat to fuel this uninterrupted    [  edit  ]         The migrates the longest distance of any  Seabird migration is similar in pattern to those of the waders and waterfowl. Some, such as the and some gulls are quite sedentary; others, such as most terns and auks breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. The has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding   [ 37 ]   One Arctic tern, ringed (banded) as a chick on the off the British east coast, reached Melbourne Australia in just three months from fledging, a sea journey of over 22,000km (14,000mi). Many tubenosed birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern   [ 38 ]    most pelagic species, mainly in the 'tubenose' order Procellariiformes are great wanderers, and the albatrosses of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the "roaring forties" outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are also among the longest-distance migrants; nesting on the migrate 14,000km (8,700mi) between the breeding colony and the Atlantic off Norway Some do this same journey in reverse. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking Manx shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year   [ 39 ]     migration in   [  edit  ]         large broad-winged birds rely on of rising hot air to enable them to soar. These include many of such as vultures eagles and buzzards but also storks These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the of Gibraltar Falsterbo and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the honey can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi   [ 40 ]   Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and   [ 41 ]          the bottleneck of the of point of transit of the migrations, seen from the Peloritani Sicily   migration in smaller insectivorous   [  edit  ]          of the smaller insectivorous birds including the warblers hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at night. They land in the morning and may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. The birds are referred to as in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and   [ 42 ]    migrants minimize predation, avoid overheating, and can feed during the   [ 1 ]   One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep. Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep to compensate for the   [ 43 ]     and altitudinal   [  edit  ]          article:  long-distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper and may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin and move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their   [ 44 ]    passerine migrants have two evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants in the same family, such as the are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration to stay in the northern   [ 45 ]    that have no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the waxwings Bombycilla are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding   [ 46 ]    the tropics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as   [ 47 ]    migration is common on mountains worldwide, such as in the Himalayas and the Andes .

In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere are more likely to migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to   [ 51 ]     and   [  edit  ]   control of migration, its timing and response are genetically controlled and appear to be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as   [ 52 ]     Timing   [  edit  ]   primary physiological cue for migration are the changes in the day length. These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds. In the period before migration, many birds display higher activity or Zugunruhe German   first described by Friedrich in 1795, as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird   [ 53 ]   Caged birds display a preferential flight direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature, changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics change   [ 54 ]    polygynous species with considerable males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. This is termed   [ 55 ]      [ 56 ]     and   [  edit  ]         The routes of satellite tagged migrating north from This species has the longest known non-stop migration of any species, up to 10,200km article:   Navigation is based on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields magnetoception use visual landmarks as well as .   [ 57 ]    distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite wintering sites. Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same wintering sites year after   [ 58 ]    ability of birds to navigate during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, even with the help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind   [ 59 ]    birds may use two electromagnetic tools to find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a pair whereby chemical reactions in special sensitive to are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this "mapping" is done by magnetites in the which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its   [ 60 ]   There is a neural connection between the eye and "Cluster N", the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the   [ 61 ]      [ 62 ]     Vagrancy   [  edit  ]   birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges. This can be due to flying past their destinations as in the "spring  in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended. Certain areas, because of their location, have become famous as watchpoints for such birds. Examples are the Pelee National in Canada, and Spurn in England .  where the genetic programming of young birds fails to work properly, can lead to rarities turning up as vagrants thousands of kilometres out of   [ 63 ]     of birds blown off course by the wind can result in "falls" of large numbers of migrants at coastal   [ 64 ]    related phenomenon called "abmigration" involves birds from one region joining similar birds from a different breeding region in the common winter grounds and then migrating back along with the new population. This is especially common in some waterfowl, which shift from one flyway to   [ 65 ]       [  edit  ]   has been possible to teach a migration route to a flock of birds, for example in re-introduction schemes. After a trial with microlight aircraft were used in the US to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced .   [ 66 ]      [ 67 ]     Adaptations   [  edit  ]   need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be molted. The timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding   [ 68 ]      [ 69 ]   Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of   [ 70 ]     and ecological   [  edit  ]   in birds is highly labile and is believed to have developed independently in many avian   [ 71 ]   While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian   [ 72 ]   This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial   [ 73 ]    analyses show that detours that increase flight distance by up to 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds - a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of which fly far east across before turning south via Florida to reach northern this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other   [ 74 ]       [  edit  ]   scale climatic changes, as have been experienced in the past, are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration. Studies have shown a variety of effects including timing changes in migration,   [ 75 ]   as well as population   [ 76 ]      [ 77 ]       [  edit  ]   migration of birds also aids the movement of other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and   [ 78 ]   which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health.

[ 87 ]    isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur can establish avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and breeding grounds. Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that are incorporated into inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or   [ 88 ]      [ 89 ]    approach to identify migration intensity makes use of upward pointing microphones to record the nocturnal contact calls of flocks flying overhead.
