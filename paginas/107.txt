After completing a test chamber, the robots are disassembled and reassembled at the next chamber. After completing each set of chambers, they are returned to a central hub. The puzzles in each set of chambers focus on a particular testing element or puzzle-solving technique. In the first four sets, GLaDOS prepares the robots to venture outside of the test systems of Aperture Laboratories to recover data disks. She destroys them and restores their memories to new bodies—which also happens when they die in a test chamber hazard.

[ 37 ]   Valve committed more resources to development than they had for the first   [ 2 ]   Portal had a team of seven or eight people, but had a team of 30 or   [ 37 ]      [ 43 ]   The initial team of four was expanded as subgroups formed to devise game mechanics and to plot the story. Participants in internal review processes were inspired by what they saw to join the project. According to Erik Wolpaw, some developers worked on the  4  games to help them meet milestones, but returned to "with extra people in   [ 44 ]   Kim Swift, Portal designer, left Valve for halfway through   [ 45 ]    manager Erik Johnson said Valve's goal for was to find a way to "re-surprise" players, which he considered a "pretty terrifying"   [ 27 ]   In March 2011, one month before the game's release, Valve president called "the best game we've ever   [ 46 ]   After release, wrote that according to Newell, will probably be Valve's last game with an isolated single-player   [ 11 ]   Keighley later stated that the use of the word "probably" suggests that "this could   [ 47 ]   Newell said that Valve is not "giving up on single-player at all", but intends to include more social features on top of the single player experience, akin to the cooperative mode in .

The first type, which Valve calls "checklisting", provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to providing challenging and rewarding puzzles. Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings. The developers performed a on the chamber before crafting simple levels with a software tool called the level Extensive playtesting ensured the solutions to each chamber were neither too obvious nor too difficult, and observed alternative solutions discovered by playtesters. Based on play-testing results, the design team retained these alternative solutions or blocked them if they were considered too   [ 51 ]   These versions were sent back for further play-testing to verify that the new elements did not prevent players from finding solutions; further iterations between artists and playtesters occurred until such issues were   [ 51 ]   Some elements from Portal were modified to suit whereas players of Portal would be familiar with the game mechanics, novice players required some training, as would players of Portal for some game elements. For example, the energy spheres used in the first game were replaced with lasers, which provided immediate feedback and reduced the in-game training   [ 34 ]    designers built several of early chambers by applying decay, collapse, and overgrowth to Portal chambers to give Portal players a sense of nostalgia and a sense of time passed in the game's world. The design team replaced low resolution textures from the first game with higher-resolution, dirty textures that the new game engine could   [ 52 ]   The middle section of the single-player campaign takes place in large in-game spaces in which most surfaces are unable to accept portals, which forces players to find creative ways to cross   [ 32 ]   Much of the architecture in these sections was inspired by photographs of industrial complexes, including CERN NASA and the abandoned space .   [ 53 ]   According to writer in the game's final section, in which Wheatley controls the Aperture facility, "the level designers just had a blast" creating deranged chambers reflecting Wheatley's   [ 54 ]   The designers recognized that solving puzzles would mentally tire players, so they inserted occasional "experiences" to provide a respite and to advance the   [ 55 ]          features gels that impart special properties to surfaces or objects they touch.

Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve adventure .   [ 27 ]      [ 37 ]      [ 56 ]   The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's  4  cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing   [ 4 ]   While the single player campaign in is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes they are much more difficult than the single-player   [ 62 ]   Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult   [ 3 ]   Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further   [ 3 ]      [ 23 ]   Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate   [ 3 ]   The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal   [ 37 ]    considered adding a competitive mode to According to Wolpaw, the mode was similar to the video game  Speedball  ;   [ 63 ]   one team would try to transport a ball from one side of the playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended into chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative   [ 64 ]     Writing   [  edit  ]         Writers (left), and at the 2012 Developers receiving the "Best Narrative" award for  Wolpaw,   veteran and  4  writer Chet Faliszek wrote the game's   [ 2 ]   Wolpaw and Pinkerton wrote the single-player campaign story, while Faliszek wrote GLaDOS's lines for the cooperative   [ 65 ]   The game has 13,000 lines of   [ 66 ]   The writers felt they needed to create a larger story for a stand-alone title, and wanted the game to "feel relatively intimate", and avoided adding too many new   [ 65 ]   They considered expanding the "sterility and dryness" of Portal and adding more comedy to the script. Wolpaw said that while some developers have been moving towards no one had made a comedic video   [ 65 ]   The game's story development was tightly coordinated with the gameplay development and   [ 67 ]      [ 68 ]    developers of initially envisioned it as a prequel to Portal set in the 1950s, long before GLaDOS took over the Aperture Science facility, with events set in motion when Aperture CEO Cave Johnson becomes trapped within a   [ 50 ]   Johnson would have led an army of robots, which would battle against the player to rise to power within   [ 11 ]      [ 49 ]   In June 2008, based on information from a casting call website and leaked script samples, Kotaku reported that Valve was seeking voice actors to play Johnson, named him as an AI and identified the game as a   [ 69 ]      [ 70 ]   Valve attributed this leak to an "overeager   [ 11 ]   Following negative playtester feedback about the omission of Chell and GLaDOS, was re-conceived as a sequel. The team returned to the idea of exploring parts of the facility from Aperture's early days, and reincorporated Johnson through a series of   [ 11 ]    writers originally conceived several premature joke game endings if the player performed certain actions, but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped. One of these joke endings was triggered by shooting a portal onto the moon's surface, after which the player's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song, but the idea of creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game's final   [ 34 ]   The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending, but this was not considered funny   [ 71 ]   In an early version of the script, Chell finds a lost "tribe" of turrets looking for their leader, a huge "Animal King" turret which can be seen in in-game videos of the retail product. As a reward, the Animal King would have married Chell to a turret, which would have followed Chell around the game without visible   [ 68 ]   The cooperative campaign was planned to feature a more detailed storyline, in which GLaDOS would send two robots to discover human artifacts, such as a comic based on a pastiche of  Garfield  The writers hoped to use this idea to make the robots human-like for testing purposes, but recognized that unlike the captive audience of the single-player campaign, the two players in cooperative mode may simply talk over the story, and thus the story was condensed into very basic   [ 71 ]    said that while many story elements of Portal are revisited in he avoided some of the memes as the frequently repeated "the cake is a lie".
