Robinson's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups. They settled on the Mount Rushmore location, which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure. Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like and ,   [ 5 ]   and Bill ,   [ 6 ]   but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain. After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of "Mount Rushmore's great political patron", U.S. Senator ,   [ 7 ]   construction on the memorial began in 1927, and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. Upon Gutzon Borglum's death in March 1941, his son took over construction. Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist, lack of funding forced construction to end in late October   [ 8 ]    Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States, and has appeared in works of fiction, and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works.

Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Memorial a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on in Georgia but was in disagreement with the officials   [ 12 ]          Construction of the Mount Rushmore original plan was to perform the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles However, Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun.

Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader B. but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that   [ 19 ]   In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was Sculptor's Studio— a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting— was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum.

The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic roughly 1.6 billion years   [ 34 ]   Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Harney Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic they were re-exposed again during the around 70 million years   [ 34 ]   The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic   [ 35 ]   Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist.

Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite.
