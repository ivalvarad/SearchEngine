However, it is often difficult to precisely determine the location of a watershed in a region of level plains, such as in central The British and American committees that met after the of to resolve boundary disputes recognized there would be much animosity in surveying the watershed boundary, and agreed on a simpler border solution in 1818: the 49th parallel. Both sides gained and lost some territory by this convention, but the United States gained more than it lost, in particular securing title to the River This convention established the boundary only between the of the and the west of the Rockies, the convention established joint occupation of the by both parties. A geographical oversight resulted in the creation of the . the Convention of 1818 settled the boundary from the point of view of the non-Aboriginal powers, neither the United Kingdom nor the United States was immediately sovereign over the territories on its side of the line: effective control still rested with the local nations, mainly the Métis Assiniboine Lakota and Blackfoot Their sovereignty was gradually ceded by conquest and treaty during the several decades that followed. Among these nations, the 49th parallel was nicknamed the because of its seemingly magical ability to prevent U.S. soldiers from crossing the U.S. presidential the asserted that the northern border of the should be 54°40′, later reflected in the 1846 slogan Forty or However, the boundary was settled diplomatically in the 1846 Oregon Treaty. This agreement divided the Oregon Country between North and the United States by extending the 49th parallel boundary to the west coast, ending in the of it then circumvents through and the of Juan de This had the side-effect of isolating Roberts, .

The 49th parallel north as a border between the Canadian provinces of Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba (to the north), and the US states of Washington Idaho Montana and Minnesota (to the parts of Vancouver Island and parts of Eastern Canada are south of the 49th parallel, and parts of the United States Alaska are north of it, the term is sometimes used metonymically to refer to the entire Canada-U.S. border. Actually, many of Canada's most populated regions (and about 72% of the population) are south of the 49th parallel, including the two largest cities Toronto (43°42′ north) and Montreal (45°30′ north), the federal capital Ottawa (45.25° north) and the capitals of all provinces except the Alberta Saskatchewan and Manitoba these being the only provinces entirely north of the 49th parallel. The three are each entirely south of the parallel, but the vast majority of Canadian territory lies north of of the 49th parallel were originally surveyed using astronomical techniques that did not take into account slight departures of the Earth's shape from a simple ellipsoid or the deflection of the plumb-bob by differences in terrestrial mass. The surveys were subject to the limitations of early to mid-19th century technology, but accurate results were obtained. However, in some places the surveyed 49th parallel is several hundred feet from the geographical 49th parallel for the currently adopted datum the American of 1983 (NAD 83). The Chart of the (DCW), which uses the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid, reports the border on average at latitude 48°59′51″north, roughly 270 metres (886ft) south of the modern 49th parallel. It ranges between 48°59′25″ and 49°0′10″north, 810 metres (2,657ft) and 590 metres (1,936ft) on either side of the average. In any case, the Earth's North Pole moves around slightly, notionally moving the 49th and other parallels with it; see . is the only part of the contiguous 48 states that goes north of the 49th parallel. This was due to an erroneous map that showed the source of the as being north of the 49th the time that the United States and Great Britain agreed on the 49th parallel as the boundary, much of the North American continent had not yet been mapped. After the boundary was established, British surveyors discovered that lay south of the 49th parallel. The British requested that the United States cede the territory to Great Britain, but no action was ever 1909 the United States, United Kingdom and Canada signed and ratified a treaty confirming the original survey lines as the official and permanent international border. Nevertheless, the difference of the survey from the geographical 49th parallel was argued in front of the Supreme in the case of of Washington v. under the premise that Washington did not properly incorporate the portions of land north of the geographical 49th parallel, as laid out by detailed GPS surveying. The court decided against the premise, ruling that the internationally surveyed boundary also served as the state boundary, regardless of its actual  Survey of Great   [  edit  ]   national grid reference uses the point 49° N, as its true origin.     49°00′00″N 2°00′00″W    /    /        [ 2 ]       [  edit  ]    parallel   parallel   (Manitoba/North  (northern Lake of the Woods  boundary    of    Weißwurstäquator    References   [  edit  ]      ^    http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/Dur_OneYear.php      ^     true to OS Southampton: Ordnance Survey.
