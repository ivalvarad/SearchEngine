Energy-absorbing buffer stop in France        This buffer stop is designed to move up to 7 metres (23ft) to slow down a 850-tonne (840-long-ton; 940-short-ton) passenger train from 15km/h (9.3mph) without damaging the train or injuring       A buffer stop or on the  or bumper (US) is a device to prevent from going past the end of a physical section of track . design of the buffer stop is dependent in part upon the kind of couplings that the railway uses, since the is the first part of the vehicle that the buffer stop touches.

Rigid buffers can only safely cope with very low-speed impacts i.e. nearly stationary). To improve stopping performance, a way of dissipating this energy is needed, through compression or friction. Following a buffer stop accident at am in 1902, the Rawie company developed a large range of energy-absorbing buffer stops. Similar hydraulic buffer stops were developed by  in the [     ]     [  edit  ]         Dowty it is desired to slow or stop moving trains, without erecting a solid buffer stop, may be employed.
