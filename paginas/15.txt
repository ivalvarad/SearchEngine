This work was the starting point of the Triangulation of Great (1783–1853), and led to the creation of the Ordnance Survey itself. Roy's technical skills and leadership set the high standard for which Ordnance Survey became known. Work was begun in earnest in 1790 under Roy's supervision, when the of (a predecessor of part of the modern of began a national military survey starting with the south coast of 1791, the Board received the newer (an improved successor to the one that Roy had used in 1784), and work began on mapping southern Great Britain using 5-mile baseline on that Roy himself had previously measured and that crosses the present A set of postage stamps, featuring maps of the Kentish village of Hamstreet was issued in 1991 to mark the 1801, the first one-inch-to-the-mile (1:63,360 scale) map was published, detailing the county of Kent with Essex following shortly after.

At the same time the uneven quality of the English and Scottish maps was being improved by engravers under By the time Colby retired in 1846, the production of six-inch maps of Ireland was complete.

Following a fire at its headquarters at the of in   [ 12 ]   the Ordnance Survey relocated to a site in Southampton and was in disarray for several years, with arguments about which scales to use. Major-General Sir was by then Director General, and he saw how photography could be used to make maps of various scales cheaply and easily. He developed and exploited photozincography not only to reduce the costs of map production but also to publish facsimiles of nationally important manuscripts. Between 1861 and 1864, a facsimile of the was issued, county by county; and a facsimile of the was issued in the 1840s, the Ordnance Survey concentrated on the Great Britain modelled on the earlier Ireland survey. A start was made on mapping the whole country, county by county, at six inches to the mile (1:10,560). From 1854, to meet requirements for greater detail, including land-parcel numbers in rural areas and accompanying information, cultivated and inhabited areas were mapped at 1:2500 (25.344inches to the mile), at first parish by parish, with blank space beyond the parish boundary, and later   [ 13 ]   Early copies of the 1:2500s were available hand-coloured. Up to 1879, the 1:2500s were accompanied by Books of Reference or "area books" that gave acreages and land-use information for land-parcel numbers. After 1879, land-use information was dropped from these area books; after the mid-1880s, the books themselves were dropped and acreages were printed instead on the   [ 14 ]   After 1854, the six-inch maps and their revisions were based on the "twenty-five inch" maps and theirs. The six-inch sheets covered an area of six by four miles on the ground; the "twenty-five inch" sheets an area of one by one and a half. One square inch on the "twenty-five inch" maps was roughly equal to an acre on the ground. In later editions the six-inch sheets were published in "quarters" (NW,NE,SW,SE), each covering an area of three by two miles on the ground. The first edition of the two scales was completed by the 1890s. A second edition (or "first revision") was begun in 1891 and completed just before the First World War. From 1907 till the early 1940s, a third edition (or "second revision") was begun but never completed: only areas with significant changes on the ground were revised, many two or three   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]    funding had been agreed in the 1850s for a more detailed survey of towns and cities. From 1850–53, twenty-nine towns were mapped at 1:528 (10 feet to the mile). From 1855 1:500 (10.56 feet to the mile) became the preferred scale. London and some seventy other towns (mainly in the north) were already being mapped at 1:1056 (5 feet to the mile). Just under 400 towns with a population of over 4000 were surveyed at one of these three scales, most at 1:500. Publication of the town plans was completed by 1895. The London first edition was completed and published in 326 sheets in the 1860s–70s; a second edition of 759 sheets was completed and brought out in the early 1890s; further revisions (incomplete coverage of London) followed between 1906 and 1937. Very few other towns and cities saw a second edition of the town   [ 16 ]      [ 14 ]    1911 onwards– and mainly between 1911 and 1913– the Ordnance Survey photo-enlarged many 1:2500 sheets covering built-up areas to 1:1250 (50.688inches to the mile) for Land Valuation and Inland Revenue purposes. About a quarter of these 1:1250s were marked "Partially revised 1912/13". In areas where there were no further 1:2500s, these partially revised "fifty inch" sheets represent the last large-scale revision (larger than six-inch) of the County Series. The County Series mapping was superseded by the Survey National 1:1250s, 1:2500s and 1:10,560s after the World .   [ 14 ]    the late 19th century to the early 1940s, the OS produced many "restricted" versions of the County Series maps and other War Department sheets for purposes, in a variety of large scales that included details of military significance such as dockyards, naval installations, fortifications and military camps.
