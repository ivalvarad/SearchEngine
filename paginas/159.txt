After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Mexica capital of Mexico-Tenochtitlan . its name was thought to come from Nahuatl tetl  [ˈtetɬ]  ("rock") and nōchtli  [ˈnoːtʃtɬi]  and is often thought to mean "Among the prickly pears [growing among] rocks". However, one attestation in the late 16th-century manuscript known as "the Bancroft dialogues" suggests the second vowel was short, so that the true etymology remains   [ 34 ]    suffix -co is the Nahuatl locative making the word a place name. Beyond that, the etymology is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is derived from Mextli or Mēxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Mexicas, Huitzilopochtli in which case Mēxihco means "Place where Huitzilopochtli   [ 35 ]   Another   [ 36 ]   suggests that Mēxihco derives from a portmanteau of the Nahuatl words for "Moon" Mētztli and navel xīctli This meaning ("Place at the Center of the Moon") might then refer to Tenochtitlan's position in the middle of The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from Mēctli, the goddess of maguey .   [ 36 ]    name of the city-state was transliterated to Spanish as México with the phonetic value of the letter 'x' in Medieval Spanish, which represented the postalveolar [ʃ] This sound, as well as the postalveolar [ʒ] represented by a 'j', evolved into a velar [x] during the 16th century. This led to the use of the variant Méjico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanish–speaking countries México was the preferred spelling. In recent years the Academia which regulates the Spanish language, determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended spelling is   [ 37 ]   The majority of publications in all Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the alternative variant is still occasionally [     ] In English the 'x' in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster [ks] . official name of the country has changed as the of has changed.

Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico.

This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent   [ 49 ]    Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands; it merely expected tributes to be paid. It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city-state was conquered and the Aztecs did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tribute payments were   [ 50 ]    Aztecs of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central   [ 51 ]   Aztecs were noted for practicing human on a large scale. Along with this practice of delayed death, the killing of enemies on the battlefield was avoided; making their warring casualty rate far lower than their Spanish counterparts whose principal objective was immediate slaughter during   [ 52 ]   This distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, and over the next centuries Mexican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial   [ 53 ]     conquest  information: conquest of        and meet .

Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30–46%. The difference is indicative of directional mating involving preferentially immigrant men and Native American women. This type of genetic asymmetry has been observed in other populations, including Brazilian individuals of African ancestry, as the analysis of sex specific and autosomal markers has revealed evidence for substantial European admixture that was mediated mostly through men. In our 384 completely sequenced Mexican American mitochondrial genomes, 12 (3.1%) are of African ancestry belonging to haplogroups L0a1a’3’, L2a1, L3b, L3d and U6a7; 52 (13.6%) belong to European haplogroups HV, JT, U1, U4, U5; and K and the majority (320, 83.3%) are of Native American ancestry."
