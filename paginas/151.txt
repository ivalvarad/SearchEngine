It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, modifications, environmental arrangement and procedures. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The word  technology  comes from Greek  τεχνολογία from  τέχνη meaning "art, skill, craft", and  -λογία -logía ) meaning "study of-". The term can be applied either generally or to many specific areas, examples of which include and . human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the the telephone and the Internet have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to . has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's and has allowed the rise of a leisure class Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the or worsens it. Neo-Luddism anarcho-primitivism and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other   about                 edit          Acid2  is a test page published and promoted by the Standards to expose rendering flaws in and other that render It was developed in the spirit of Acid1 a relatively narrow test of compliance with the Style 1.0 (CSS1) standard and was released on April 13, 2005. Like Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image. Acid2 tests aspects of HTML markup, CSS 2.1 styling, PNG images, and The Acid2 test page will be displayed correctly in any application that follows the Wide Web and Engineering Task specifications for these technologies. These specifications are known as because they describe how technologies used on the web are expected to function. While at the time of Acid2's release no web browser passed the test, Acid2 was designed with Internet particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer did not follow web standards and, consequently, Internet Explorer was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers. Acid2 represented a challenge to Microsoft to bring Internet Explorer in line with web standards, making it easier to design web pages that work as intended in any web browser.   ...Archive/Nominations     More...        edit    this      October 1957 – The launches     the first Earth  October 1826 – The   (pictured) the first railroad to use the and the begins October 2013 – and win the Prize in for the discovery of the    October 1793 – applies for a patent on the   dramatically altering the economy of the United          edit     you       that in 1912   donated money and property worth   ₹  lakh  (US$23,000) to for the establishment of College of Science and (pictured) ?

His uncompromising stances on certain historical and calendrical issues led to Zhang being considered a controversial figure, which prevented him from becoming an official court historian. Zhang applied his extensive knowledge of mechanics and gears in several of his inventions. He invented the world's first water-powered to represent astronomical observation; improved the inflow by adding another tank; and invented the world's first seismometer which discerned the of an earthquake 500km (310mi) away. Furthermore, he improved previous Chinese calculations of the for His  fu  (rhapsody) and  shi  poetry were renowned and commented on by later Chinese writers.
