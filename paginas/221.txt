Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many parts of the world, especially in conservative and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive   [ 115 ]      [ 116 ]   In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general sexualization of the whole culture.

Studies like Dale Spender's of the (1986) and Jane Spencer's Rise of the Woman (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Virago Press began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation.
