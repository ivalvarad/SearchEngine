The Cupisnique culture which flourished from around 1000 to 200   [ 16 ]   along what is now Peru's Pacific Coast was an example of early pre-Incan culture. The that developed from 1500 to 300 BC was probably more of a religious than a political phenomenon, with their religious centre in de .   [ 17 ]   After the decline of the Chavin culture around the beginning of the Christian millennium, a series of localized and specialized cultures rose and fell, both on the coast and in the highlands, during the next thousand years. On the coast, these included the civilizations of the Paracas Nazca Wari and the more outstanding Chimu and Mochica The Mochica, who reached their apogee in the first millennium AD, were renowned for their irrigation system which fertilized their arid terrain, their sophisticated ceramic pottery, their lofty buildings, and clever metalwork. The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as loose confederation of cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru and southern Ecuador, the Chimu flourished from about 1150 to 1450. Their capital was at outside of modern-day Trujillo In the highlands, both the Tiahuanaco culture, near in both Peru and Bolivia and the near the present-day city of Ayacucho developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000   [ 18 ]          The citadel of an iconic symbol of pre-Columbian the 15th century, the Incas emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the in with their capital in Cusco .   [ 19 ]   The Incas of Cusco originally represented one of the small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the Quechuas Gradually, as early as the thirteenth century, they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors. Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the great emperor Pachacuti Under his rule and that of his son, Inca the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt   [ 20 ]   From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, from southern Colombia to Chile between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was Quechua although hundreds of local languages and dialects were spoken. The Inca referred to their empire as Tawantinsuyu which can be translated as "The Four Regions" or "The Four United Provinces." Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred  Huacas  but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama .

In December 1532, a party of  conquistadors  led by defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the of The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was one of the most important campaigns in the colonization of the After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the of with its capital at Lima which became known as "The City of Kings". The conquest of the Inca Empire led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the in Vilcabamba in indigenous population dramatically collapsed due to exploitation, socioeconomic change and epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish. Viceroy de reorganized the country in the 1570s with gold and silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian as its primary   [ 23 ]   With the discovery of the great silver and gold lodes at Potosí (present-day Bolivia) and Huancavelica the viceroyalty flourished as an important provider of mineral resources. Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines .   [ 24 ]   Because of lack of available work force, African slaves were added to the labor population. The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization. With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to Catholicism, taking only a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the Coricancha in the city of Cusco. The church employed the Inquisition making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs. Peruvian Catholicism follows the syncretism found in many Latin American countries, in which religious native rituals have been integrated with Christian   [ 25 ]   In this endeavor, the church came to play an important role in the acculturation of the natives, drawing them into the cultural orbit of the Spanish the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal   [ 26 ]   In response, the Crown enacted the a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the   [ 27 ]   The new laws provoked Amaru rebellion and other revolts, all of which were   [ 28 ]   As a result of these and other changes, the Spaniards and their creole successors came to monopolize control over the land, seizing many of the best lands abandoned by the massive native depopulation. However, the Spanish did not resist the expansion of across the meridian.

These movements led to the formation of the majority of modern-day countries of South America in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of   [ 29 ]   The conquest and colony brought a mix of cultures and ethnicities that did not exist before the Spanish conquered the Peruvian territory. Even though many of the Inca traditions were lost or diluted, new customs, traditions and knowledge were added, creating a rich mixed Peruvian   [ 25 ]     Independence  article: War of        The of was decisive in ensuring Peruvian       Map of the Republic of Peru in the mid the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by of Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of de San and . economic crises, the loss of power of Spain in Europe, the war of independence in North America and native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipating ideas among the  criollo  population in South America. However, the criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in Argentina where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, de San created the of the and crossed the Andes in 21 days, a great accomplishment in military history. Once in Chile he joined forces with Chilean army General and liberated the country in the battles of Chacabuco and Maipú in 1818. On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of Paracas under the command of general Jose de San Martin and who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of Pisco San Martin settled in Huacho on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of Callao in Lima. At the same time in the north, Guayaquil was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin’s strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the Viceroy that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved       San Martín proclaiming the independence of Peru. Painting by  Viceroy of Peru, de la named de la commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a coup against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jose de la Serna, and proposed to create a constitutional monarchy, a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of liberated it three years later. Jose de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a American floundered and a with proved   [ 30 ]    Bolivar launched his campaign from the north liberating the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the Battles of Carabobo in 1821 and Pichincha a year later.

In 1879, Peru entered the of the which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the of and the provinces of Tacna and Arica in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were and Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of B. The caused the downfall of Leguía, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the Popular Revolutionary   [ 34 ]   The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the of returned Tacna to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a war with over a territorial dispute involving the and its capital Leticia Later, in 1941, Peru became involved in the after which the sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, Gen. A. became president. Odría's presidency was known as the Ochenio Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his régime. Odría was succeeded by Prado However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by Pérez Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Belaúnde who assumed presidency until 1968. Belaúnde was recognized for his commitment to the democratic process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General Velasco staged a coup against Belaúnde. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General Morales forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of       Areas where the was active in engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced the Peruvian currency, the sol was replaced by the  Inti  in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's GDP dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like (Shining Path) and MRTA which caused throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the  auto-golpe  ("self-coup") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by insurgent groups, most notably Sendero Luminoso, which carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the Altos and Cantuta by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of Tarata and by Sendero Luminoso. Those incidents subsequently came to be seen as symbols of the human rights violations committed during the last years of       Lima, that time in early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed exile, avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities.
