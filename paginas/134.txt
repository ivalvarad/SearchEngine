Franklin Roosevelt, the number two official in the Navy Department during World War I, appreciated the Navy and gave it strong support.

This led to the development of the AN/SPY-1 phased array radar and the with the combat coordinating the two.

All cruisers since CG-47 have been named for famous battles with USS S. (CG-51) as the only exception.

For surface strikes, navy aircraft utilize a combination of missiles, smart bombs, and dumb bombs. On the list of available missiles are the Maverick SLAM-ER and JSOW Smart bombs include the GPS-guided JDAM and the laser-guided Paveway series. Unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and make up the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed-wing aircraft weapons are focused on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and light to medium surface engagements. To combat submarines, helicopters use Mark 46 and Mark 50 torpedoes. Against small watercraft, they utilize Hellfire and Penguin air to surface missiles.
