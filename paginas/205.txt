Wikipedia requires the use of published Sources, particularly internet sources, should also be stable, that is they should be high enough quality that they will continue to exist for future generations. There are many places to find reliable sources, including your local library, but if internet-based sources are to be used, start with books and searches rather than a simple web search. Extra care should be taken to make sure that articles on   have reliable sources – articles about living people without reliable sources may be deleted, especially if they include negative or controversial content.

Before creating an article, try to make sure there is not already an article on the same topic, perhaps under a slightly different name. Search for the article, and review Wikipedia's titling before creating your first article. If an article on your topic already exists, but you think people might look for it under some different name or spelling, learn how to redirects to alternative adding needed redirects is a good way to help Wikipedia. Also, remember to check the article's in order to avoid creating an article that has already been deleted. (In some cases, the topic may be suitable even if deleted in the past; the past deletion may have been because it was a copyright violation, did not explain the importance of the topic, or on other grounds addressed to the writing rather that the topic's a search does not find the topic, consider broadening your search to find existing articles that might include the subject of your article. For example, if you want to write an article about a band member, you might search for the band and then add information about your subject as a section within that broader     Notability   Academics     Books   Events   Films     Music   Numbers   and   People   and     ( )  deletion   was the page I created    v     t     e   sources for the information you will be writing about. To be worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, a subject must be sufficiently notable and that notability must be verifiable through citations to . noted, the sources you use must be reliable that is, they must be sources that exercise some form of editorial control and have some reputation for fact checking and accuracy. Print sources (and web-based versions of those sources) tend to be the most reliable, though some web-only sources may also be reliable. Examples might include (but are not limited to) books published by major publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals, websites of any of the above, and other websites that meet the same requirements as a reputable print-based general, sources with no editorial control are not reliable. These include (but are not limited to) books published by vanity presses, self-published 'zines', blogs, web forums, usenet discussions, personal social media, fan sites, vanity websites that permit the creation of self-promotional articles, and other similar venues. If anyone at all can post information without anyone else checking that information, it is probably not put it simply, if there are reliable sources (such as newspapers, journals, or books) with extensive information published over an extended period about a subject, then that subject is notable and you must cite such sources as part of the process of creating (or expanding) the Wikipedia article. If you cannot find such that provide extensive and comprehensive information about your proposed subject, then the subject is not notable or verifiable and almost certainly will be deleted. So your first job is to find to are many places to find reliable sources, including your local library, but if internet-based sources are to be used, start with books and searches rather than a web you have references for your article, you can learn to place the references into the article by reading for and Do not worry too much about formatting citations properly.

Putting your friends in an encyclopedia may seem like a nice surprise or an amusing joke, but articles like this are likely to be removed In this process, feelings may be hurt and you may be blocked from editing if you repeatedly make attempts to re-create the article. These things can be avoided by a little forethought on your part. The article may remain if you have enough humility to make it neutral and you really are notable, but even then it's best to submit a draft for approval and consensus of the community instead of just posting it up, since unconscious biases may still exist of which you may not be frequently add pages to Wikipedia without considering the topic is really notable to go into an encyclopedia. Because Wikipedia does not have the space limitations of paper-based encyclopedias, our notability policies and guidelines allow a wide range of articles – however, they do not allow every topic to be included. A particularly common special case of this is pages about people, companies, or groups of people, that do not substantiate the notability or importance of their subject with reliable sources, so we have decided that such pages may be speedily deleted under our WP:SPEEDY policy. This can offend – so please consider whether your chosen topic is notable enough for Wikipedia, and then substantiate the notability or importance of your subject by citing those reliable sources in the process of creating your article. is a directory of everything in Advertising do not to promote your product or Please do not insert external links to your commercial website unless a neutral party would judge that the link truly belongs in the article; we do have articles about products like Kleenex or Sharpies or notable businesses such as McDonald's but if you are writing about a product or business be sure you write from a point of that you have no of and that you are able to find references in that are independent from the subject you are writing essays or original surveys existing human knowledge; it is not a place to publish new work.
