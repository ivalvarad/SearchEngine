The High Court is the court of final appeal with the ability to interpret the for the whole of Australia, not just the state or territory in which the matter arose. The High Court's broad jurisdiction is similar to that of the Court of and unlike the Court of the United which has a more limited jurisdiction. As such, the court is able to develop the common law consistently across all the states and territories. This role, alongside its role in constitutional interpretation, is one of the court's most significant. As Owen said on his swearing in as Chief Justice of High Court's jurisdiction is divided in its exercise between constitutional and federal cases which loom so largely in the public eye, and the great body of litigation between man and man, or even man and government, which has nothing to do with the Constitution, and which is the principal preoccupation of the   [ 2 ]    broad array of jurisdiction enables the High Court to take a leading role in Australian law and contributes to a consistency and uniformity among the laws of the different   [ 3 ]       [  edit  ]   original jurisdiction of the High Court refers to matters that are originally heard in the High Court. The Constitution confers actual (section 75) and potential (section 76) original 75 of the Constitution confers original jurisdiction in regard to "all under any consuls or other representatives of other which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the conferral of original jurisdiction creates some problems for the High Court. For example, challenges against immigration-related decisions are often brought against an officer of the Commonwealth within the original jurisdiction of the High 76 provides that Parliament may confer original jurisdiction in relation to under the constitution or involving its under any laws made by the admiralty and maritime to the same subject matter claimed under the laws of different matters, referred to in section 76(i), have been conferred to the High Court by section 30 of the  Act  .   [ 4 ]   However, the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76, rather than section 75, means that the High Court's original jurisdiction regarding constitutional matters could be removed. In practice, section 75(iii) (suing the Commonwealth) and section 75(iv) (conflicts between states) are broad enough that many constitutional matters would still be within jurisdiction. The original constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court is now well established: the Law Reform has described the inclusion of constitutional matters in section 76 rather than section 75 as "an odd fact of   [ 5 ]   The Constitutional recommended an amendment to the constitution to prevent the possibility of the jurisdiction being removed by Parliament. Failure to proceed on this issue suggests that it was considered highly unlikely that Parliament would ever take this requirement of "a matter" in section 75 and section 76 of the constitution means that a concrete issue must need to be resolved and the High Court cannot give an advisory   [ 6 ]       [  edit  ]   High Court's appellate jurisdiction is defined under Section 73 of the Constitution. The High Court can hear appeals from the Supreme Courts of the States any federal court or court exercising federal jurisdiction (such as the Court of and decisions made by one or more Justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the section 73 allows the appellate jurisdiction to be limited "with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes". Parliament has prescribed a large limitation in section 35A of the Act This requires "special leave" to appeal. Special leave is granted only where a question of law is raised that is of public importance; or involves a conflict between courts; or "is in the interests of the administration of justice". Therefore, while the High Court is the final court of appeal, it cannot be considered a general court of appeal. The decision as to whether to grant special leave to appeal is determined by one or more Justices of the High Court (in practice, a panel of two or three judges). That is, the Court exercises the power to decide which appeal cases it will [     ]   to the Privy   [  edit  ]         High Court issue of appeals from the High Court to the United Kingdom's Committee of the Privy was a significant one during the drafting of the Constitution and it continued to be significant in the years after the court's final wording of section 74 prohibited appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits   of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified the appeal. It did so only once: in the case of  Sugar Refining Co v    [ 7 ]   After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another   [ 8 ]   Indeed, in the case of  v Captain Cook Cruises Pty  (1985), the court said that it would never again grant a certificate of   [ 9 ]    general matters, however, section 74 did not prevent the Privy Council from granting leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in  Consolidated Press Ltd v     [ 10 ]   (1967), or in  v The     [ 11 ]   (1978)), by using a that stated that different common law can apply to different   [ 12 ]   However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In  v The     [ 13 ]   (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the of in v saying, "I shall not depart from the law on this matter as we have long since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case should not be used in Australia as authority at   [ 13 ]   the following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords   [ 14 ]    74 did provide that the parliament could make laws to prevent appeals to the council and it did so, beginning in 1968, with the Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act which closed off all appeals to the Privy Council in matters involving federal legislation. In 1975, the Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act was passed, which had the effect of closing all routes of appeal from the High Court. Appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council are now only theoretically possible in   matters if the High Court grants a certificate of appeal under section 74 of the Constitution. As noted above, the High Court indicated in 1985 it would not grant such a certificate in the future and it is practically certain that all future High Courts will maintain this policy. In 1986, with the passing of the by both the and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States), appeals to the Privy Council from state Supreme Courts were closed off, leaving the High Court as the only avenue of  jurisdiction for   [  edit  ]   per an agreement between Nauru and Australia in 1976, in application of article 57 of the of the High Court of Australia is the ultimate court of appeal for the sovereign Republic of Nauru, formerly an Australian League of Nations mandate.

Before the establishment of the High Court, appeals from the state Supreme Courts could be made only to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which involved the great expense of travelling to London. For this reason some politicians in the colonies wanted a new court that could travel between the colonies hearing 1846 proposal for federation of the Australian colonies, an 1849 report from the Privy Council of the United Kingdom suggested that a national court be   [ 16 ]   In 1856, the then of South Graves suggested to the of South that they and the other colonies should consider establishing a court of appeal that would hear appeals from the Supreme Courts in each colony, and in 1860 the of South passed legislation encouraging MacDonnell to put forward the idea to his colleagues in the other colonies. However, only the of seriously considered this   [ 17 ]    an inter-colonial conference in 1870 in Melbourne the idea of an inter-colonial court was again raised and subsequently a was established in Victoria to investigate options for establishing a court of appeal and for unifying extradition laws between the colonies and other similar matters. A draft bill establishing a court was put forward by the Commission, but it completely excluded appeals to the Privy Council, which reacted critically and prevented any serious attempts to implement the bill in London (before federation any laws affecting all the colonies would have to be passed by the Imperial in   [ 17 ]    1880 another inter-colonial conference was convened, which proposed the establishment of an Australasian Court of Appeal. This conference was more firmly focussed on having an Australian court. Another draft bill was produced, providing that judges from the colonial Supreme Courts would serve one-year terms on the new court, with one judge from each colony at a given time. New Zealand, which was at the time also considering joining the Australian colonies in federation, was also to be a participant in the new   [ 17 ]   However, the proposal retained appeals from colonial Supreme Courts to the Privy Council, which some of the colonies disputed, and the bill was eventually    [  edit  ]         Samuel first Justice of  of the 1890s, which met to draft an Australian Constitution, also raised the idea of a federal Supreme Court. Initial proposals at a conference in Melbourne in February 1890 led to a convention in Sydney in March and April 1891, which produced a draft constitution. The draft included the creation of a Supreme Court of Australia, which would not only interpret the Constitution, like the United States Supreme Court, but also would be a court of appeal from the state Supreme Courts. The draft effectively removed appeals to the Privy Council, allowing them only if the gave leave to appeal and not allowing appeals at all in constitutional draft was largely the work of Samuel ,   [ 8 ]   then the of later Chief Justice of Queensland and the first Chief Justice of Australia. Other significant contributors to the judicial clauses in the draft included Attorney-General of Tasmania Inglis who had prepared his own constitution prior to the convention. Inglis Clark's most significant contribution was to give the court its own constitutional authority, ensuring the of the original formulation from Griffith, and provided only that the parliament could establish a   [ 16 ]          Inglis prominent contributor to the clauses about the High Court in the of . the later conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later the same year and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, the name of the court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court completely replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that   [ 8 ]   Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English   [ 16 ]   Some politicians, such as George supported the petitioners, but others, including supported the design of the court as it   [ 8 ]   Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good thing, for the law could adapt appropriately to Australian   [ 16 ]   Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different the draft had been approved by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899, for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. However the issue of Privy Council appeals remained a sticking point with a number of Australian and British politicians, including the of State for the the Chief Justice of South Australia, Samuel and the Chief Justice of Queensland, Samuel .   [ 12 ]   Indeed, in October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offering some alterations of his   [ 12 ]   Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and although they were under instructions that they would never agree to   [ 12 ]    intense lobbying both in Australia and in the United Kingdom, the Imperial Parliament finally approved the draft constitution, albeit with an altered section 74, which represented a compromise between the two sides: there would be a general right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council, except that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make laws restricting this avenue, and also that appeals in matters (matters concerning the boundary between and limits of the powers of the Commonwealth and the powers of the states) were not as of right, but had to be certified by the High   [ 12 ]      of the   [  edit  ]         The first Justice of Samuel is administered the judicial oath at the first sitting of the High Court, in the Banco Court of the Court of 6 October Constitution was passed by the Imperial Parliament, and came into effect on 1 January 1901. However, the High Court was not established immediately; it was necessary for the new Parliament of Australia to make laws about the structure and procedure of the court. Some of the of the First including John then one of the leading legal experts in Australia, opposed legislation to set up the court. Even B. who was himself later appointed to the court, objected to setting it up, on the grounds that it would be impotent while Privy Council appeals remained, and that in any event there was not enough work for a federal court to make it   [ 8 ]    1902, the then Attorney-General Alfred Deakin introduced the Bill in the House of Representatives. Although Deakin and Griffith had produced a draft bill as early as February 1901, it was continually delayed by opponents in the parliament, and the success of the bill is generally attributed to Deakin's passion and effort in pushing the bill through the parliament despite this   [ 16 ]   Deakin had proposed that the court be composed of five judges, specially selected to the court; opponents instead proposed that the court should be made up of state Supreme Court justices, taking turns to sit on the High Court on a rotation basis, as had been mooted at the Constitutional Conventions a decade   [ 18 ]   Deakin eventually negotiated amendments with the opposition reducing the number of judges from five to three, and eliminating financial benefits such as one point, Deakin even threatened to resign as Attorney-General due to the difficulties he   [ 16 ]   In what is now a famous speech, Deakin gave a to the of lasting three and a half hours, in which he federation is constituted by distribution of powers, and it is this court which decides the orbit and boundary of every power...

On 6 October, the court held its first sitting in the Banco Court in the Court of . 12 October 1906, the size of the High Court was increased to five Justices, and Deakin appointed B. and to the High  years of the   [  edit  ]         The court's home between 1928 and 1980, the purpose-built courtroom in Bourke Street, . the court's first sitting in the Banco Court in Melbourne the court continued to use that court until 1928, when a dedicated courtroom was built in Bourke next to the Court of which provided the court's Melbourne sitting place and housed the court's principal registry until   [ 20 ]   The court also sat regularly in Sydney, where it originally shared space in the Criminal Courts in the suburb of Darlinghurst before a dedicated courtroom was constructed next door in   [ 21 ]          The annexe to the Criminal Court in Darlinghurst the court's home in court travelled to other cities across the country, where it did not have any facilities of its own but used facilities of the Supreme Court in each city. Deakin had envisaged that the court would sit in many different locations, so as to truly be a federal court. Shortly after the court's creation, Chief Justice Griffith established a schedule for sittings in state capitals: Hobart Tasmania in February, Brisbane Queensland in June, Western in September and Adelaide, South Australia in October; it is said that Griffith established this schedule because those were the times of year he found the weather most pleasant in each city. The tradition remains to this day, although most of the court's sittings are now conducted in were dependent on the caseload and to this day sittings in Hobart occur only once every few years. There are annual sittings in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane for up to a week each. During the sittings outside of Melbourne and Sydney were suspended to reduce War the court faced a period of change. The Chief Justice, John served from 1940 to 1941 as Australia's first ambassador to Japan, although his activities in this role were limited by the mutual assistance pact that Japan had entered into with the before he could arrive in Tokyo, and were curtailed by the commencement of the .   [ 22 ]   Justice Sir Owen Dixon was also absent for several years, while he served as Australia's minister to the United States in Washington .

There were many difficult cases concerning the use of the defence power during the    [  edit  ]   1952, with the appointment of Sir Owen Dixon as Chief Justice, the court entered a period of stability. After World War II, the court's workload continued to grow, particularly from the 1960s onwards, putting pressures on the   [ 24 ]   Garfield who was Attorney-General from 1958 to 1964, and from then until 1981 Chief Justice, proposed that more federal courts be established, as permitted under the Constitution.

In  v    [ 29 ]   Griffith criticised the Court of for following a Privy Council decision about the of rather than following the High Court's own decision on the Australian   [ 17 ]    constitutional the early decisions of the court were influenced by States constitutional In the case of  v    [ 30 ]   which involved the application of Tasmanian to a federal official's salary, the court adopted the doctrine of implied immunity of instrumentalities which had been established in the United States Supreme Court case of  v.    [ 31 ]   That doctrine established that any attempt by the federal government to interfere with the legislative or executive power of the Australian states was invalid, and vice versa. Accompanying that doctrine was the doctrine of State which was based on the principle that the powers of the Australian parliament should be interpreted narrowly, to avoid intruding on areas of power traditionally exercise by the state parliaments. The concept was developed in such cases as  v    [ 32 ]    v    [ 33 ]   and the Label   [ 34 ]    the two doctrines helped smooth the transition to a federal system of government and "by preserving a balance between the constituent elements of the Australian federation, probably conformed to community sentiment, which at that stage was by no means adjusted to the exercise of central   [ 28 ]   The court had a generally conservative view of the Constitution, taking narrow interpretations of section 116 (which guarantees religious freedom) and section 117 (which prevents discrimination on the basis of someone's state of origin), interpretations that were to last well into the   [ 28 ]    of the original judges of the Court, Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton, were frequently consulted by governors-general, including on the exercise of the .

The most significant case of the era was the   [ 36 ]   decided at the beginning of Knox's term.
