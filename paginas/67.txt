It is also called the venous although it is not the only example of a venous and which is not synonymous with portal and is imprecise (as it means  visceral and not necessarily the of the abdominal ).   [ 1 ]     Contents   1 Function     2     3     4 References     5     6     Function   [  edit  ]   venous is responsible for directing blood from parts of the to the liver Substances absorbed in the small intestine travel first to the liver for processing before continuing to the heart. Not all of the is part of this system. The system extends from about the lower portion of the esophagus to the upper part of the It also includes venous drainage from the spleen and pancreas . drugs that are absorbed through the are substantially metabolized by the liver before reaching general circulation. This is known as the pass As a consequence, certain drugs can only be taken via certain routes. For example, nitroglycerin cannot be swallowed because the liver would inactivate the medication, but it can be taken the or transdermal (through the skin) and thus is absorbed in a way that bypasses the portal venous system. Inversely, dextromethorphan a cough suppressor, is best taken orally because it needs to be metabolised by the liver into dextrorphan in order to be effective. This latter principle is that of most prodrugs The use of suppository is a way to by-pass partially the the upper 1/3 of the rectum is drained into the while the lower 2/3 are drained into the iliac that goes directly in the vena (thus by-passing the flow to the liver is unique in that it receives both oxygenated and (partially) deoxygenated blood. As a result, the gas of oxygen 2 and perfusion pressure of portal blood are lower than in other organs of the body. Blood passes from branches of the portal vein through cavities between "plates" of hepatocytes called sinusoids Blood also flows from branches of the and mixes in the sinusoids to supply the hepatocytes with oxygen. This mixture percolates through the sinusoids and collects in a central vein which drains into the The hepatic vein subsequently drains into the vena The provides 30 to 40% of the oxygen to the liver, while only accounting for 25% of the total liver blood flow. The rest comes from the partially deoxygenated blood from the Interestingly, the liver consumes about 20% of the total body oxygen when at rest. That is why the total liver blood flow is quite high, at about 1 litre a minute and up to two litres a minute. That is on average one fourth of the average at veins that are considered part of the venous are  portal     mesenteric   mesenteric  mesenteric and the come together to form the actual portal The mesenteric connects in the majority of people on the but in some people, it is known to connect on the or the mesenteric . the portal venous system corresponds to areas supplied by the the mesenteric and the mesenteric .
