The and efficient implementation of the algorithm are important in computing, and this depends on suitable . the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe although many algorithms are much more complex; algorithms often have steps that repeat iterate or require decisions (such as logic or comparison Algorithms can be composed to create more complex concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers. The concept was formalized in 1936 through and which in turn formed the foundation of . algorithms can be directly implemented by any other algorithms can at least in theory be simulated by computer programs. In many programming languages, algorithms are implemented as functions or   all selected          edit           Fool   spiral diagram represents all   less than The first (outermost) turn of the spiral represents the finite ordinal numbers, which are the regular starting with zero As the spiral completes its first turn (at the top of the diagram), the ordinal numbers approach infinity or more precisely the first transfinite ordinal number (identified with the set of all counting numbers, a set, the cardinality of which corresponds to the first transfinite called The ordinal numbers continue from this point in the second turn of the spiral with and so forth. (A special is defined to give meaning to these expressions, since the + symbol here does not represent the addition of two Halfway through the second turn of the spiral (at the bottom) the numbers approach or The ordinal numbers continue with through (three-quarters of the way through the second turn, or at the "9 o'clock" position), then through and so forth, up to at the top. (As with addition, the multiplication and exponentiation operations have definitions that work with transfinite numbers.) As one would expect, the ordinals continue in the third turn of the spiral with through then through up to at the top of the third turn. Continuing in this way, the ordinals increase by one power of for each turn of the spiral, approaching in the middle of the diagram, as the spiral makes a countably infinite number of turns. This process can actually continue through and and so on, approaching the uncountable number, which (assuming the of corresponds to only the second transfinite cardinal number, the cardinality (according to the of the set of .   selected            edit     you       the for make use of the only two that are neither composites nor 0 and 1 ? as of April 2010 only 35 even numbers have been found that are not the sum of two primes which are each in a pair? ref  Piphilology record (memorizing digits of Pi is in excess of 67000 as of Apr a denoted P(i), i=1,2,3..., when i is prime then P(i) is composite, being divisible by was successfully used in 1994 to sell FCC airwave spectrum, in a financial application of ? of have application in many fields of mathematics including combinatorics algebra calculus and geometry ? in makes use of which has foundations in the behavorial examples found in nature of ants, birds, bees, and fish among              7 items out of     Moredidyouknow      edit     WikiProjects     is the center for mathematics-related editing on Wikipedia.
