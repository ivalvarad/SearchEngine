It is a masterpiece of and would probably have been used for display rather than worn in battle. The helmet consists of an iron cap completely covered with bands of bronze. The bronze is in turn covered with unusually pure gold leaf, with embedded coral decorations attached using silver rivets. One of the cheek guards was also found and has similar materials and designs. The helmet is mostly decorated in early Celtic patterns but there are later Celtic motifs and signs of Etruscan or Greek influence. The quality of the gold indicates that the helmet may well have been made locally in the Atlantic  Contents   1 Discovery     2 Context     3 Structure     4 Decoration     5 Origin     6 Notes     7 Sources     Discovery   [  edit  ]   Agris helmet was found in a cave near Angoulême in   [ 1 ]   The Perrats cave had been known for just over a week when cavers found two contiguous parts of the front of the helmet on 9–10 May 1981.

Other motifs are from an intermediate stage with the .   [ 2 ]    differ on the date of the helmet. In a 2001 paper José Gomez De Soto suggests the middle or the second half of the 4th   [ 10 ]   D. W. Harding says the stratigraphic association of the helmet with a Dux-type  fibula  from La Tène B and other signs indicate that it was made in the later part of the 4th   [ 1 ]   However, in a 2010 paper Gomez de Soto and Stephane Verger conclude that the decorations, when viewed as a whole, indicate that the helmet was made in the 2nd quarter or the middle of the 4th   [ 11 ]     Structure   [  edit  ]         View of the helmet showing the neck guard (lower left) and cheek protector (lower helmet has been described as having a jockey-cap shape, but the "bill" of the cap is actually a   [ 12 ]   It is 21.4 centimetres (8.4in) high and 23 by 19 centimetres (9.1 by 7.5in)   [ 13 ]   The inner cap of the helmet is of iron, now heavily   [ 2 ]   It is made of a single piece of hammered iron, with the neck guard riveted to the   [ 11 ]   The iron is entirely covered by ornamental bronze bands with low-relief decoration formed partly by casting and partly by and .

Gold leaf was then applied generously around the coral to form a small   [ 16 ]    is a finely wrought   [ 7 ]   The cheek guard paragnathide and the side and top ornaments used the same materials and techniques as the main helmet. There are signs that organic materials such as wood and leather were also   [ 11 ]     Decoration   [  edit  ]   helmet is particularly richly   [ 5 ]   The main theme is a series of palmettes, with many of the palmettes and studs infilled with   [ 1 ]   The ornamentation is arranged into three superimposed bands completely covered by compositions inspired by plants. The many different patterns combined into complex compositions make the headpiece one of the richest of ancient Celtic   [ 11 ]    the lower and upper panels a series of unconnected palmettes are arranged formally in friezes. The central panel decorations are based on a formal arrangement of S-curves terminating in swelling leaves, with a filler pattern that includes palmettes, comma-leaves and over-and-under tendrils. The neck-guard has a less formal and more fluid pattern. The cheek guard has a palmette design in which may be seen a curled serpent that appears to be horned. Horned serpents are often found in Romano-Celtic works in Britain and France, but very rarely in early La Tène. The depiction on the helmet may have some special   [ 1 ]    decoration mainly reflects the 5th century Early Style of Celtic Art, but some motifs are characteristic of the Waldalgesheim style of the 4th   [ 11 ]   The central panel designs show similarities to the Waldalgesheim   [ 1 ]   This indicates that the helmet was made in the first half of the 4th century. The large palmettes with seven petals in the lower band and the main frieze in the central band may have been inspired by architectural terracotta from Tyrrhenian central Italy in the 5th and 4th centuries. The neck guard combines Waldalgesheim style with elements of 4th century Greek or Etruscan   [ 11 ]        on the     on the lower     on the center     on the upper  Origin   [  edit  ]         The Amfreville helmet, another Celtic prestige helmet from the Atlantic main regions of the Celtic world have been proposed as the origin of the helmet. The first is the northern or central Adriatic region of Italy. Some think the new plant-style compositions were developed by Celtic craftsmen who settled in Italy and were influenced by Etruscan or Greek craftsmen with whom they had direct contact. The complexity of the montage and decoration may be explained by proximity to advanced metalworking centers such as those of Taranto or Campania The objection is that all Celtic helmets from the period found in Italy were in one piece. Those with riveted neck guards have all been found in the Alps, the regions north of the Alps or the Atlantic   [ 17 ]    second proposed region of origin is the North Alpine area that formed the ancient center of Celtic culture. The materials and techniques, and the general composition and decoration, seem to place the work among the best 5th century Celtic works from this   [ 17 ]   The conical shape of the top of the helmet seems to be derived from Celtic helmets from the start of the second iron age. Where these were decorated, the decorations were in superimposed bands. Some details of the plant ornamentation are very similar to small Celtic ornaments from Austria, the Alpine regions and western Switzerland. This is the area where helmets with riveted neck guards are found most   [ 17 ]    third possibility is that the helmet was made in the area where it was found. It is one of a small set of prestige helmets that were mostly found in western France, the most famous being the completely decorated helmet of Amfreville-sous-les-Monts in the   [ 17 ]   All were made of an iron or bronze cap covered with bands of another metal that were completely decorated. They have red ornaments, mostly coral. Riveted neck pieces are also found in this   [ 17 ]    samples from various parts of the helmet are exceptionally pure, typically 99% gold, 0.5% silver and 0.2%   [ 18 ]   This degree of purity is very unusual in the ancient   [ 18 ]   Analysis of Greek and Etruscan objects of the period shows much higher silver   [ 9 ]   Most ancient objects with this degree of purity have been found to the southwest of the Loire the region that includes   [ 9 ]   The only comparable objects are 3rd century Celtic jewelry from this   [ 18 ]   Probably the helmet was made in the West by craftsmen trained in the North Alpine   [ 10 ]   The gold may well have come from mines in the west of the which had been in operation since at least the 5th century BC.

This is   [ 4 ]        ^   rivets are made of an alloy with at least 80% silver, 20% gold and almost 1% copper.
