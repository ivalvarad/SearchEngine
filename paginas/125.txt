The ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte. Within the megagametophyte one of the two sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]   Later the zygote will give rise to the embryo of the seed, and the endosperm mother cell will give rise to endosperm a nutritive tissue used by the the ovules develop into seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes or form a hard outer covering (as in nuts).

In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals sepals and stamens fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off.

Each pistil forms a fruitlet, and collectively the fruitlets are called an etaerio. Four types of aggregate fruits include etaerios of achenes, follicles, drupelets, and berries. Ranunculaceae species, including  Clematis  and  Ranunculus  have an etaerio of achenes,  Calotropis  has an etaerio of follicles, and  Rubus  species like raspberry, have an etaerio of drupelets.

Commercial cultivars of bananas and pineapples are examples of Some cultivars of citrus fruits (especially navel oranges satsumas grapefruit and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness. In some species, seedlessness is the result of  parthenocarpy  where fruits set without fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit set may or may not require pollination but most seedless citrus fruits require stimulus from pollination to produce bananas and grapes are triploids and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant that is produced by fertilization, a phenomenon known as  stenospermocarpy  which requires normal pollination and   [ 24 ]      in fruit structures largely depend on the of of the seeds they contain.

At the store, they should not be damaged or bruised and pre-cut pieces should be refrigerated or surrounded by ice. All fruits and vegetables should be rinsed before eating. This recommendation also applies to produce with rinds or skins that are not eaten. It should be done just before preparing or eating to avoid premature spoilage. Fruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat, poultry, and seafood, as well as utensils that have come in contact with raw foods. Fruits and vegetables, if they are not going to be cooked, should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs.
