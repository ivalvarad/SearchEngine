All beaks are composed of two jaws, generally known as the upper mandible (or maxilla) and lower mandible (or   [ 3 ]   The upper, and in some cases the lower, mandibles are strengthened internally by a complex three-dimensional network of bony spicules (or trabeculae seated in soft and surrounded by the hard outer layers of the   [ 4 ]      [ 5 ]   The avian jaw apparatus is made up of two units; one mechanism and one five-bar linkage   [ 6 ]     Mandibles   [  edit  ]         A gull's upper mandible can flex upwards because it is supported by small bones which can move slightly backwards and upper mandible is supported by a three-pronged bone called the intermaxillary. The upper prong of this bone is embedded into the forehead, while the two lower prongs attach to the sides of the skull At the base of the upper mandible a thin sheet of nasal bones is attached to the skull at the nasofrontal hinge, which gives mobility to the upper mandible allowing it to move upwards and   [ 2 ]          Position of vomer (shaded red) in neognathae (left) and paleognathae base of the upper mandible or the roof when seen from the mouth is the palate, the structure of which differs greatly in the ratites Here the vomer is large and connects with premaxillae and maxillopalatine bones in a condition termed as a "paleognathous palate". All other extant birds have a narrow forked vomer that does not connect with other bones and is then termed as neognathous. The shape of these bones varies across the bird lower mandible is supported by a bone known as the inferior maxillary bone—a compound bone composed of two distinct ossified pieces. These ossified plates (or rami which can be U-shaped or   [ 3 ]   join distally (the exact location of the joint depends on the species) but are separated proximally attaching on either side of the head to the quadrate bone. The jaw muscles, which allow the bird to close its beak, attach to the proximal end of the lower mandible and to the bird's   [ 7 ]   The muscles that depress the lower mandible are usually weak except in a few birds such as the starlings and the extinct Huia which have well developed that aid in foraging by prying or gaping   [ 8 ]   In most birds, these muscles are relatively small as compared to the jaw muscles of similarly sized   [ 9 ]     Rhamphotheca   [  edit  ]   outer surface of the beak consists of a thin horny sheath of keratin called the rhamphotheca ,   [ 2 ]      [ 7 ]   which can be subdivided into the rhinotheca of the upper mandible and the gnathotheca of the lower   [ 10 ]   This covering arises from the Malpighian cells of the bird's epidermis ,   [ 10 ]   growing from plates at the base of each   [ 11 ]   There is a vascular layer between the rhamphotheca and the deeper layers of the dermis, which is attached directly to the periosteum of the bones of the   [ 12 ]   The rhamphotheca grows continuously in most birds and in some species the color varies   [ 13 ]   In some Alcids, such as the puffins, parts of the rhamphotheca are shed each year after the breeding season while some pelicans shed a part of the bill called a "bill horn" that develops in the breeding   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]      [ 16 ]    most extant birds have a single seamless rhamphotheca, species in a few families, including the albatrosses    [ 10 ]   and the emu have compound rhamphothecae that consist of several pieces separated and defined by softer keratinous   [ 17 ]   Studies have shown that this was the primitive ancestral state of the rhamphotheca, and that the modern simple rhamphotheca resulted from the gradual loss of the defining grooves through evolution .   [ 18 ]     Tomia   [  edit  ]         The sawtooth serrations on a bill help it to hold tight to its fish tomia (singular "tomium") are the cutting edges of the two   [ 19 ]   In most birds, these range from rounded to slightly sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications which allow them to better handle their typical food   [ 20 ]   Granivorous (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia which help the bird to slice through a seed's outer hull .   [ 21 ]   Most falcons have a sharp projection along the upper mandible, with a corresponding notch on the lower mandible. They use this "tooth" to fatally sever their prey's vertebrae or to rip insects apart. Some kites principally those that prey on insects or lizards, also have one or more of these sharp   [ 22 ]   as do the shrikes .   [ 23 ]   Some fish-eating species, like the mergansers have sawtooth serrations along their tomia which help them to keep hold of their slippery, wriggling   [ 24 ]    in roughly 30 families have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most of these species are either insectivorous (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the of between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey   [ 25 ]   Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy .   [ 26 ]   In some cases, the color of a bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar is pinkish-red, without darker   [ 27 ]     Culmen   [  edit  ]         A thrush's culmen is measured in a straight line from the tip of the beak to a set point — here, where the feathering starts on the bird's culmen is the dorsal ridge of the upper   [ 28 ]   Likened by ornithologist to the ridge line of a roof, it is the "highest middle lengthwise line of the bill" and runs from the point where the upper mandible emerges from the forehead's feathers to its   [ 29 ]   The bill's length along the culmen is one of the regular measurements made during banding ,   [ 30 ]   and is particularly useful in feeding   [ 31 ]   There are several standard measurements that can be made—from the beak's tip to the point where feathering starts on the forehead, from the tip to the anterior edge of the nostrils, from the tip to the base of the skull, or from the tip to the cere (for raptors and   [ 32 ]   scientists from various parts of the world generally favor one method over   [ 31 ]   In all cases, these are (measured in a straight line from point to point, ignoring any curve in the culmen) taken with calipers .

For example, the culmen of the is strongly decurved, while that of the very similar is more moderately   [ 33 ]   The culmen of a juvenile northern is all dark, while that of the very similarly plumaged juvenile is pale towards the   [ 34 ]     Gonys   [  edit  ]   gonys is the ventral ridge of the lower mandible, created by the junction of the bone's two rami, or lateral   [ 35 ]   The proximal end of that junction—where the two plates separate—is known as the or In some gull species, the plates expand slightly at that point, creating a noticeable bulge; the size and shape of the gonydeal angle can be useful in identifying between otherwise similar species. Adults of many species of large gulls have a reddish or orangish near the gonydeal   [ 36 ]   This spot triggers in gull chicks. The chick pecks at the spot on its parent's bill, which in turn stimulates the parent to regurgitate   [ 37 ]     Commissure   [  edit  ]   on its usage, commissure may refer to the junction of the upper and lower   [ 38 ]   or alternately, to the full-length apposition of the closed mandibles, from the corners of the mouth to the tip of the   [ 39 ]     Gape   [  edit  ]         A young starling with a bright yellow the gape is the interior of the open mouth of a bird and the is the region where the two mandibles join together, at the base of the   [ 40 ]   The width of the gape can be factor in the choice of   [ 41 ]          The gape flange on this juvenile is the yellowish region at the base of the of juvenile altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, and these are believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the   [ 42 ]   Some species especially in the families Viduidae and Estrildidae have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low   [ 43 ]   A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to   [ 44 ]   Parents may however not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain   [ 45 ]    gape color has been shown in several experiments to induce feeding. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system with nestlings showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell immunocompetence and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid   [ 46 ]   Conversely, the red gape of the did not induce extra feeding in host   [ 47 ]   Some such as the have colored patches on the wing that mimic the gape color of the parasitized   [ 48 ]    born, the chick's gape flanges are fleshy. As it grows into a fledgling the gape flanges remain somewhat swollen and can thus be used to recognize that a particular bird is   [ 49 ]   By the time it reaches adulthood, the gape flanges will no longer be  Nares   [  edit  ]         Falcons have a small tubercule within each species of birds have external nares nostrils located somewhere on their beak. The nares are two holes—circular, oval or slit-like in shape—which lead to the within the bird's skull, and thus to the rest of the .   [ 50 ]   In most bird species, the nares are located in the basal third of the upper mandible. Kiwis are a notable exception; their nares are located at the tip of their   [ 20 ]   A handful of species have no external nares. Cormorants and darters have primitive external nares as nestlings, but these close soon after the birds fledge adults of these species (and gannets and boobies of all ages, which also lack external nostrils) breathe through their   [ 10 ]   There is typically a septum made of bone or cartilage that separates the two nares, but in some families (including gulls, cranes and New World vultures) the septum is   [ 10 ]   While the nares are uncovered in most species, they are covered with feathers in a few groups of birds, including grouse and ptarmigans, crows, and some   [ 50 ]   The feathers over a ptarmigan's nostrils help to warm the air it   [ 51 ]   while those over a woodpecker's nares help to keep wood particles from clogging its nasal   [ 52 ]    in the bird order Procellariformes have nostrils enclosed in double tubes which sit atop or along the sides of the upper   [ 50 ]   These species, which include the albatrosses, petrels, diving petrels, storm petrels, fulmars and shearwaters, are widely known as   [ 53 ]   A number of species, including the falcons have a small bony tubercule which projects from their nares. The function of this tubercule is unknown. Some scientists suggest it may act as a baffle, slowing down or diffusing airflow into the nares (and thus allowing the bird to continue breathing without damaging its respiratory system) during high-speed dives, but this theory has not been proved experimentally. Not all species that fly at high speeds have such tubercules, while some species which fly at low speeds   [ 54 ]     Operculum   [  edit  ]         The operculum is a soft swollen mass at the base of the nares of some birds are covered by an operculum (plural opercula a membraneous, horny or cartilaginous   [ 55 ]      [ 56 ]   In diving birds, the operculum keeps water out of the nasal   [ 55 ]   when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the   [ 57 ]   Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to help to keep pollen from clogging their nasal   [ 55 ]   while the opercula of the two species of  Attagis help to keep dust   [ 58 ]   The nares of nestling are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselves—both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. These opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach   [ 59 ]   In pigeons the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits at the base of the bill, above the   [ 60 ]   though it is sometimes referred to as the  cere  this is a different   [ 61 ]   Tapaculos are the only birds able to move their   [ 50 ]     Cere   [  edit  ]   from a handful of families—including raptors, owls, skuas, parrots, turkeys and curassows—have a waxy structure called a cere (from the Latin cera which means "wax") which covers the base of their bill. This structure typically contains the nares, except in the owls, where the nares are distal to the cere. Although it is sometimes feathered in   [ 62 ]   the cere is typically bare and often brightly   [ 20 ]   In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the "quality" of a bird; the orangeness of a cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical   [ 63 ]   The cere color of young has an ultraviolet (UV) component, with a UV peak that correlates to the bird's mass. A chick with a lower body mass has a UV peak at a higher wavelength than a chick with a higher body mass does. Studies have shown that parent owls preferentially feed chicks with ceres that show higher wavelength UV peaks, that is, lighter-weight   [ 64 ]    color or appearance of the cere can be used to distinguish between males and females in some species. For example, the male has a yellow cere, which the female (and young males)   [ 65 ]   The male budgerigar cere is blue, while the female's is pinkish or   [ 66 ]     Nail   [  edit  ]         The nail is the black tip of this birds of the family Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans) have a nail a plate of hard horny tissue at the tip of the   [ 67 ]   This shield structure, which sometimes spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a   [ 68 ]   It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or   [ 69 ]   while use theirs to pry molluscs from   [ 70 ]   There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide   [ 71 ]   Certain types of mechanoreceptors nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the   [ 72 ]    shape or color of the nail can sometimes be used to help distinguish between similar-looking species or between various ages of waterfowl. For example, the has a wider black nail than does the very similar .

They may help with prey detection, with navigation in darkened nest cavities, with the gathering of information during flight or with prey   [ 77 ]       [  edit  ]         This chick still has its egg tooth, the small white projection near the tip of its upper article:  chicks of most bird species have a small sharp, calcified projection on their beak, which they use to chip their way out of their egg .   [ 78 ]   Commonly known as an egg tooth, this white spike is generally near the tip of the upper mandible, though some species have one near the tip of their lower mandible instead, and a few species have one on each   [ 79 ]   Despite its name, the projection is not an actual tooth as the similarly-named projections of some reptiles are; instead, it is part of the as are claws and scales .   [ 80 ]   The hatching chick first uses its egg tooth to break the membrane around an air chamber at the wide end of the egg. Then it pecks at the eggshell while turning slowly within the egg, eventually (over a period of hours or days) creating a series of small circular fractures in the   [ 81 ]   Once it has breached the egg's surface, the chick continues to chip at it until it has made a large hole. The weakened egg eventually shatters under the pressure of the bird's   [ 82 ]   The egg tooth is so critical to a successful escape from the egg that chicks of most species will perish unhatched if they fail to develop   [ 79 ]   However, there are a few species which do not have egg teeth. Megapode chicks have an egg tooth while still in the egg but lose it before   [ 81 ]   while kiwi chicks never develop one; chicks of both families escape their eggs by kicking their way   [ 83 ]   Most chicks lose their egg teeth within a few days of   [ 78 ]   though petrels keep theirs for nearly three   [ 82 ]   and have theirs for up to a   [ 84 ]   Generally, the egg tooth drops off, though in songbirds it is   [ 82 ]     Color   [  edit  ]   color of a bird's beak results from concentrations of pigments melanins and carotenoids the epidermal layers, including the   [ 85 ]   Eumelanin which is found in the bare parts of many bird species, is responsible for all shades of gray and black; the denser the deposits of pigment found in the epidermis, the darker the resulting color. Phaeomelanin produces "earth tones" ranging from gold and rufous to various shades of   [ 86 ]   Although it is thought to occur in combination with eumelanin in beaks which are buff, tan, or horn-colored, researchers have yet to isolate phaeomelanin from any beak   [ 87 ]   More than a dozen types of carotenoids are responsible for the coloration of most red, orange, and yellow   [ 88 ]   The hue of the color is determined by the precise mix of red and yellow pigments, while the saturation is determined by the density of the deposited pigments. For example, bright red is created by dense deposits of mostly red pigments, while dull yellow is created by diffuse deposits of mostly yellow pigments. Bright orange is created by dense deposits of both red and yellow pigments, in roughly equal   [ 89 ]   Beak coloration helps to make displays using those beaks more   [ 90 ]    are capable of seeing colors in the ultraviolet range, and some species are known to have ultraviolet peaks of reflectance (indicating the presence of ultraviolet color) on their   [ 91 ]   The presence and intensity of these peaks may indicate a bird's   [ 63 ]   sexual maturity or pair bond   [ 91 ]   King and for example, show spots of ultraviolet reflectance only as adults. These spots are brighter on paired birds than on courting birds. The position of such spots on the beak may be important in allowing birds to identify conspecifics For instance, the very similarly-plumaged king and emperor penguins have UV-reflective spots in different positions on their   [ 91 ]    general, beak color depends on a combination of the bird's and diet Colors are typically brightest as the breeding season approaches, and palest after   [ 36 ]     Dimorphism   [  edit  ]         The beaks of the now-extinct Huia (female upper, male lower) show marked sexual size and shape of the beak can vary across species as well as between them; in some species, the size and proportions of the beak vary between males and females. This allows the sexes to utilize different ecological niches, thereby reducing .   [ 92 ]   For example, females of nearly all shorebirds have longer bills than males of the same   [ 93 ]   and female have beaks which are slightly more upturned than those of   [ 94 ]   Males of the larger gull species have bigger, stouter beaks than those of females of the same species, and immatures can have smaller, more slender beaks than those of   [ 95 ]   Many hornbills show in the size and shape of both beaks and casques and the female huia slim, decurved bill was nearly twice as long as the male's straight, thicker   [ 96 ]    can also differ between sexes or ages within a species. Typically, such a color difference is due to the presence of androgens For example, in melanins are produced only in the presence of testosterone castrated male house sparrows—like female house sparrows—have brown beaks. Castration also prevents the normal seasonal color change in the beaks of male and .   [ 97 ]     Functions   [  edit  ]             Three threatening an intruder. Barn owl threat displays usually include hissing and bill-snapping, as may bite or stab with their beaks to defend   [ 98 ]   Some species use their beaks in displays of various sorts. As part of his courtship, for example, the male garganey touches his beak to the blue on his wings in a fake preening display, and the male does the same with his orange sail   [ 99 ]   A number of species use a gaping, open beak in their fear and/or threat displays. Some augment the display by hissing or breathing heavily, while others clap their   [ 100 ]     Communication   [  edit  ]   number of species, including storks some owls frogmouths and the use bill clapping as a form of   [ 101 ]       [  edit  ]   have shown that some birds use their beaks to rid themselves of excess heat. The which has the largest beak relative to the size of its body of any bird species, is capable of modifying the to its beak. This process allows the beak to work as a "transient thermal radiator", reportedly rivaling an in its ability to radiate body   [ 102 ]   Measurements of the bill sizes of several species of found in along the North American coastlines show a strong correlation with summer temperatures recorded in the locations where the sparrows breed; latitude alone showed a much weaker correlation. By dumping excess heat through their bills, the sparrows are able to avoid the water loss which would be required by evaporative cooling—an important benefit in a windy habitat where freshwater is   [ 103 ]   Several ratites including the the emu and the use various bare parts of their bodies (including their beaks) to dissipate as much as 40% of their metabolic heat   [ 104 ]   Alternately, studies have shown that birds from colder climates (higher altitudes or latitudes and lower environmental temperatures) have smaller beaks, lessening heat loss from that   [ 105 ]     Billing   [  edit  ]         When billing, raise their beaks high and clatter them against each courtship, mated pairs of many bird species touch or clasp each other's bills.

It is nonetheless routinely done to intensively farmed poultry flocks, particularly laying and broiler breeder flocks, because it helps reduce the damage the flocks inflict on themselves due to a number of stress behaviors, including cannibalism and A cauterizing blade or infrared beam is used to cut off about half of the upper beak and about a third of the lower beak. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges. Food intake typically decreases for some period after the beak is trimmed. However, studies show that trimmed poultry's weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed   [ 115 ]    similar but separate practice, usually performed by an or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes – in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening   [ 116 ]   Amongst raptor keepers, this practice is commonly known as   [ 117 ]     tip   [  edit  ]   tip is a region found near the tip of the bill in several types of birds that forage particularly by probing. The region has a high density of nerve endings known as the of This consists of pits in the bill surface which in the living bird is occupied by cells that sense pressure changes. The assumption is that this allows the bird to perform 'remote touch', which means that it can detect movements of animals which the bird does not directly touch. Bird species known to have a 'bill-tip organ' includes members of ibisis shorebirds of the family Scolopacidae and kiwis .   [ 118 ]    is a suggestion that across these species, the bill tip organ is more well developed among species foraging in wet habitats (water column or soft mud) than in species using a more terrestrial foraging. However, it has been described in terrestrial birds too, including parrots who are known for their dextrous extractive foraging techniques. Unlike probing foragers, the tactile pits in parrots are embedded in the hard keratin (or rhamphotheca of the bill, rather than the bone, and along the inner edges of the curved bill, rather than being on the outside of the   [ 119 ]       [  edit  ]      References   [  edit  ]      ^    Charles Frederick (1835).
