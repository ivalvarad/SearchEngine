They jump out of airplanes using their parachutes to land safely on the ground. It is one of the three types of "forced entry" strategic techniques for entering a of the other two are by land and sea. The ability of to enter the battle from different locations allows paratroopers to evade fortifications that are placed to prevent attack from a specific direction, and the possible use of paratroopers forces an army to spread their defenses to protect other areas which would otherwise be safe by virtue of the geography. Another common use for paratroopers is to establish an airhead for landing other doctrine was first practically applied to warfare by the Italians and the Soviets During War however, the two countries' ground forces were often overstretched, leaving their elite paratroopers to be employed as regular infantry. Paratroopers  Fallschirmjäger  were first used extensively by the Germans during World War II and later in the war also by the western Allies. Owing to the limited capacity of cargo aircraft of the period (for example the Ju-52 they rarely, if ever, jumped in groups much larger than 20 from one aircraft. In English language parlance, this load of paratroopers is called a "stick", while any load of soldiers gathered for air movement is known as a "chalk". The terms come from the common use of white chalk on the sides of aircraft and vehicles to mark and update numbers of personnel and equipment being   [ 1 ]    World War II, paratroopers most often used parachutes of a circular or round design. These parachutes could be steered to a small degree by pulling on the risers (four straps connecting the paratrooper's harness to the connectors) and suspension lines which attach to the parachute canopy itself. German paratroopers, whose harnesses had only a single riser attached at the back, could not manipulate their parachutes in such a manner. Today, paratroopers still use round parachutes, or round parachutes modified as to be more fully controlled with toggles. The parachutes are usually deployed by a Mobility of the parachutes is often deliberately limited to prevent scattering of the troops when a large number parachute together.
