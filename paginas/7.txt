(OS) devised the national system, and it is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps (whether published by the Ordnance Survey or commercial map producers) based on those surveys. Grid references are also commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books or government planning number of different systems exist that can provide grid references for locations within the this article describes the system created solely for Great Britain and its outlying islands (including the of the grid reference is a similar system created by the Survey of for the island of Ireland. The Transverse Mercator coordinate (UTM) is used to provide grid references for world-wide locations and this is the system commonly used for the European-wide agencies also use UTM when mapping locations, or may use the grid reference (MGRS) system, or variants  Contents   1 General    1.1 shift between OSGB 36 and WGS     1.2 shift between OSGB 36 and ED     2     3     4 grid     5 parameters of the coordinate     6 Notes     7     8 References     9     General   [  edit  ]         Grid square TF.

Airy ellipsoid is a regional best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends to use the GRS80 ellipsoid used by the GPS (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The maps adopt a Mercator with an origin (the "true" origin) at 49°N 2°W (an offshore point in the which lies between the island of Jersey and the French port of ).   [ 1 ]   Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new false origin (to eliminate negative numbers), creating a 700km by 1300km grid. This false origin is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The distortion created between the OS grid and the projection is countered by a scale factor in the longitude to create two lines of longitude with zero distortion rather than one. Grid north and true north are only aligned on the 400km easting of the grid which is 2°W (OSGB36) and approx. 0′ 5″ ). 36 was also used by Admiralty until [     ] after which has been geodetic transformation between OSGB 36 and other terrestrial reference systems (like ITRF2000 ETRS89 or can become quite tedious if attempted manually. The most common transformation is called the datum which results in a typical 7m error from true. The definitive transformation from ETRS89 that is published by the OSGB is called the National Grid Transformation   [ 2 ]   This models the detailed distortions in the 1936–1962 retriangulation, and achieves backwards compatibility in grid coordinates to sub-metre  shift between OSGB 36 and WGS   [  edit  ]   difference between the coordinates on different datums varies from place to place. The longitude and latitude positions on OSGB 36 are the same as for at a point in the Atlantic Ocean well to the west of Great Britain. In Cornwall the WGS 84 longitude lines are about 70 metres east of their OSGB 36 equivalents, this value rising gradually to about 120m east on the east coast of The WGS 84 latitude lines are about 70m south of the OSGB 36 lines in South Cornwall the difference diminishing to zero in the and then increasing to about 50m north on the north coast of Scotland (If the lines are further east then the longitude value of any given point is further west Similarly, if the lines are further south, the values will give the point a more northerly latitude.) The smallest datum shift is on the west coast of Scotland and the greatest in Kent . Great Britain has not shrunk by 100+ metres; a point near now computes to be 27.6 metres closer to a point near than it did under   [ 3 ]     shift between OSGB 36 and ED   [  edit  ]   two datums are not really both in general use in any one place, but for a point in the halfway between Dover and Calais the ED50 longitude lines are about 20m east of the OSGB36 equivalents, and the ED50 latitude lines are about 150m south of the OSGB36 [     ]        Illustration of the Ordnance Survey National Grid coordinate system, with Trafalgar Square as an    [  edit  ]       the first letter, the grid is divided into squares of size 500km by 500km, outlined in dark grey on the map to the right. There are four of these which contain significant land area within Great Britain: S, T, N and H. The O square contains a tiny area of almost all of which lies below mean high   [ 4 ]    the second letter, each 500km square is subdivided into 25 squares of size 100km by 100km, each with a letter code from A to Z (omitting I) starting with A in the north-west corner to Z in the south-east corner. These squares are outlined in light grey on the map, with those containing land lettered. The central (2° W) meridian is shown in would be possible to extend the grid system over Ireland, completing the S and N squares and introducing what would become the R and M squares (with the arrangement of first letters following the same pattern as for the second letter). However, there is no motion for this at the moment, and the accuracy of the projection would start to diminish in the west of Ireland, more than 8 degrees from the central meridian. Theoretically, the system extends far over the Atlantic Ocean and well into Western Europe with square AA near Iceland and square ZZ in northern Italy. In fact, Rockall is mapped by the Ordnance Survey, but is usually shown as an inset without gridlines on a mainland sheet. However, the grid can be extended to put Rockall in grid square MC as shown in this .    [  edit  ]   each square, eastings and northings from the origin (south west corner) of the square are given numerically. For example, NH0325 means a 1km square whose south-west corner is 3km east and 25km north from the south-west corner of square NH. A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a 1km square) through to five (for a 1m square); in each case the first half of the digits is for the first coordinate and the second half for the other. The most common usage is the figure grid employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a 100m square. For example, the grid reference of the 100m square containing the summit of is   166   (Grid references may be written with or without spaces; e.g., also NN166712.) NN has an easting of 200km and northing of 700km, so the OSGB36 National Grid location for Ben Nevis is at 216600,  grid   [  edit  ]   references may also be quoted as a pair of numbers: eastings then northings in metres, measured from the southwest corner of the SV square. Note that 14 digits may be required for locations in Orkney and further north. For example, the grid reference for Voe oil in the Shetland Islands may be given as  HU396753  or 439668,1175316 . distinct, form of all-numeric grid reference is an abbreviated alphanumeric reference where the letters are simply omitted, e.g. 166712 for the summit of Ben Nevis. Unlike the numeric references described above, this abbreviated grid reference is incomplete; it gives the location relative to an OS 100×100kmsquare, but does not specify which square. It is often used informally when the context identifies the OS 2-letter square. For example, within the context of a location known to be on Landranger 41 (which extends from NN000500 in the south-west to NN400900 in the north-east) the abbreviated grid reference 166712 is equivalent to NN166712. If working with more than one Landranger sheet, this may also be given as sometimes numbers instead of the two-letter combinations are used for the 100×100km squares. The numbering follows a grid index where the tens denote the progress from West to East and the units from South to North. In the north of Scotland, the numbering is modified: the 100km square to the north of 39 is numbered N30; the square to the north of 49 is N40,  parameters of the coordinate   [  edit  ]    Datum  Mercator using   49°N 2°W   400 km west, 100 km north of True    [ 5 ]     EPSG Code:  Ellipsoid Airy   [ 6 ]     a: 6 377  563.396 m   b: 6 356  256.909 m   Flattening (derived constant):  Notes   [  edit  ]      ^    Net, The true      ^     Ordnance          ^   an online calculator (e.g., or the do-it-yourself Transverse Mercator formulas we find that OSGB 134300 metres East 25,300 metres North is 50.067712°N 5.713449°W OSGB36; the OS website tells us that same point is 50.068307N 5.714433W ETRS89.
