Science  is the methodical study of nature including testable explanations and predictions An older and closely related current meaning emerged from Aristotle whereby "science" referred to the body of reliable knowledge that is logically and rationally explained and etymology" ). science as a type of knowledge was closely linked to philosophy In the West during the modern the words "science" and "philosophy" were sometimes used interchangeably. Not until the 17th century did natural philosophy emerge as a separate branch of philosophy, which is today called "natural science". "Science" continued to denote reliable knowledge about a topic; it remains in use in modern terms such as or . the ever-evolving term "science" refers to the pursuit of knowledge, not the knowledge itself. It is often synonymous with "natural and physical science" and often restricted to those branches of study relating to the phenomena of the material universe and their laws. Although the term implies exclusion of pure mathematics, many university faculties include Mathematics Departments within their Faculty of Science. The dominant sense in ordinary use has a narrower use for the term "science." It developed as a part of science becoming a distinct enterprise of defining the of early examples include Kepler laws Galileo laws and Newton of In this period it became more common to refer to natural philosophy as "natural science." Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the of the natural world, including physics chemistry geology and biology This sometimes left the study of human thought and society in a linguistic limbo, which was resolved by classifying these areas of academic study as For example, psychology evolved from philosophy, and has grown into an area of there are both "hard" (e.g. biological psychology) and "soft" science (e.g. social psychology) fields within the discipline. As a result, and as is consistent with the unfolding of the study of knowledge and development of methods to establish facts, each area of psychology employs a scientific method. Reflecting the evolution of the development of knowledge and established facts and the use of the scientific method, Psychology Departments in universities are found within: Faculty of Arts and Science, Faculty of Arts, and a Faculty of Science. Similarly, several other major areas of disciplined study and knowledge exist today under the general rubric of "science", such as and .   about         new selections      edit           A   is a neuron that fires both when an animal performs an action and when the animal observes the same action performed by another (especially conspecific animal. Thus, the neuron "mirrors" the behavior of another animal, as though the observer were himself performing the action. These neurons have been observed in primates and in some birds In humans, they have been found in and the parietal of the brain. Some scientists consider mirror neurons one of the most important findings of neuroscience in the last decade. See for example, an essay by Ramachandran on their potential importance in imitation and language. humans, mirror neurons are found in the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca's area, a language region. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. However, like many theories of language evolution, there is little direct evidence either   ...Archive/Nominations          edit            Fir0002     is a category of transformer coils, named after their inventor, Tesla coils are composed of coupled electric Nikola Tesla actually experimented with a large variety of coils and configurations, so it is difficult to describe a specific mode of construction that will meet the wants of those who ask about Tesla coils.

This hypothesis became the basis of the which states that the individual unit of the nervous system is a single neuron. later showed that a completely enclosed each neuron, supporting Cajal's theory and weakening Golgi's reticular theory.   ...Archive/Nominations          edit     you          coloration  is a property of loudspeakers that causes the speaker to continue to emit sound when an electrical signal light in a   is created by phosphors excited by the ultraviolet radiation emitted by a plasma discharge between two flat panels of glass ? the Appalachian Storm of November led to wind gusts in excess of 100mph/87knots across and ? the two human  atria  do not have valves at their   ...Archive/Nominations           edit         portal on     on     subject on     portal on     category on     category on     School of   News Quotations Manuals Texts Images Definitions Learning                                                Overview         Glossaries         Indices         Lists         Outlines         Categories             Reference         Culture         Geography         Health         History         Mathematics         Nature         People         Philosophy         Religion         Society         Technology                   server           					 						Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Scienceoldid=644105834 "					   Categories      Science           categories:          				        						 Namespaces   Portal     Talk   Variants    Views   Read            More     Search     							    Navigation      Contents             to     					 Interaction   Help              					 Tools   links                    					 Print/export   a    as     					 Languages   Alemannisch    العربية    বাংলা    Башҡортса       Български    Boarisch    Català    Cebuano    Deutsch    ދިވެހިބަސް    Ελληνικά    Español    فارسی    Français    Frysk    한국어    हिन्दी          Interlingua    Íslenska    Italiano    Kapampangan    ქართული    Қазақша    Kiswahili    Latviešu    Lëtzebuergesch    Limburgs    Македонски       Монгол    မြန်မာဘာသာ    नेपाली    日本語    Нохчийн          Occitan    ଓଡ଼ିଆ    Oromoo    Oʻzbekcha/ўзбекча    ਪੰਜਾਬੀ    پنجابی    Polski    Português    Ripoarisch    Română       Русский    Seeltersk    සිංහල    Slovenščina    Soomaaliga       Suomi    Svenska    Tagalog    தமிழ்    Татарча/tatarça    తెలుగు    ไทย    Тоҷикӣ    Türkçe    Українська    اردو    文言    Wolof    吴语    Xitsonga    ייִדיש    粵語    中文      					     			 This page was last modified on 25 January 2015, at is available under the Commons Attribution-ShareAlike   additional terms may apply.
