The term "cold" was used, because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two sides, although there were major regional wars, known as in Korea Vietnam and Afghanistan that the two sides supported. The Cold War split the temporary wartime alliance against leaving the USSR and the US as two superpowers with profound economic and political differences: the former being a single-party Marxist–Leninist state operating planned economy and controlled press and owning exclusively the right to establish and govern communities, and the latter being a capitalist state with generally free elections and press, which also granted of and of to its citizens. A self-proclaimed neutral bloc arose with the founded by Egypt India Indonesia and Yugoslavia this faction rejected association with either the US-led West or the Soviet-led East. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat but they each armed heavily in preparation for a possible all-out world Each side had a that deterred an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to total destruction of the attacker: the doctrine of assured (MAD). Aside from the of the two sides' nuclear and deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the . first phase of the Cold War began in the first two years after the end of the Second World War in 1945. The USSR consolidated its control over the states of the Eastern Bloc while the United States began a strategy of global containment to challenge Soviet power, extending military and financial aid to the countries of Western Europe (for example, supporting the anti-Communist side in the Civil and creating the NATO alliance. The (1948–49) was the first major crisis of the Cold victory of the Communist side in the Civil and the outbreak of the (1950–53), the conflict expanded. The USSR and USA competed for influence in Latin America and decolonizing states of Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the Revolution of was stopped by the Soviets. The expansion and escalation sparked more crises, such as the (1956), the Crisis of and the Missile of 1962. Following this last crisis new phase that saw the complicate relations within the Communist sphere while US allies, particularly France, demonstrated greater independence of action. The USSR crushed the 1968 liberalization program in Czechoslovakia and the (1955–1975) ended with a defeat of the US-backed of South prompting further the 1970s, both sides had become interested in accommodations to create a more stable and predictable international system, inaugurating a period of détente that saw Arms Limitation and the US relations with the People's Republic of as a strategic counterweight to the Soviet Union.

The United States increased military, and economic on the Soviet Union, at a time when the communist state was already suffering from In the mid-1980s, the new Soviet leader introduced the liberalizing reforms of  perestroika  ("reorganization", 1987) and  glasnost  ("openness", c. 1985) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.

But after the German Army the Soviet in June 1941 and the Japanese Pearl in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers formed an alliance of convenience. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied both Britain and the Soviets through its Lend-Lease   [ 19 ]   However, Stalin remained highly suspicious and believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Nazi Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last moment and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied   [ 20 ]     of World War II   conferences regarding post-war        The at the Yalta Conference: D. and information: and  Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the   [ 21 ]   Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war   [ 21 ]   The western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through .

Roosevelt's goals – military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the and the creation of a world peace organization – were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United   [ 26 ]    the American view, Stalin seemed a potential ally in accomplishing their goals, whereas in the British approach Stalin appeared as the greatest threat to the fulfillment of their agenda. With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage and the two western leaders vied for his favors. The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and agreed to divide the Balkans into respective spheres of influence, and at Yalta Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and the   [ 26 ]          Post-war occupation zones in .
