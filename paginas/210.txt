His parents were Christian Fremery (1816–63), a wine and textile merchant, and Julie Vinman (1816–89). He worked in the workshops of the Railway   in Cologne, and then in the blast furnace and steelworks of   . studied chemistry, graduating in im then worked as a chemist, including working in England for a period. In 1883 he was employed with the in Rotterdam in developing a light filament. In the mid-1880s Fremery and the Austrian engineer (1863–1940), whom he had met in Amsterdam, took over the technical management of a light bulb factory in Gelnhausen .   [ 1 ]    1885 Fremery married Margarete Alder. She died in 1892, and in 1897 he married Clara Lürmann (1871–1924), daughter of a Swedish   [ 1 ]     manufacture   [  edit  ]   Swiss chemist Eduard (1818–60) had found in 1857 that cotton could be dissolved in a solution of copper salts and ammonia and then   [ 2 ]   In 1890 the French chemist Louis Henri Despeissis invented the cuprammonium process for spinning fibers from cotton dissolved in .   [ 2 ]   Despeissis died in 1892 and his patent was not   [ 3 ]   In 1891 Fremery and Urban adapted the Despaissis process to make electric lamp filaments from carbon   [ 4 ]   In 1892 they founded an incandescent electric lamp manufacturing company, in Oberbruch in the Heinsberg district. The Solingen merchant Hermann Heuser and Fremery's family subscribed the initial capital of 300,000   [ 5 ]   Fremery and Urban manufactured their lamp filaments using cotton and Schweizer's   [ 3 ]    two years production had reached acceptable volumes, and from 1894 the company was delivering lamps to France in significant quantities. In 1895 the factory employed 36 men and 46 women, and was producing about 400,000 lamps per   [ 5 ]   That year the factory was operating night and day to meet demand, mostly from England and   [ 6 ]   Although prices were low, the company was profitable due to low wages and the use of water   [ 7 ]   By 1900 the company had 350 employees, and still had low production costs. However, it was struggling to remain profitable in the face of the low prices of the major electrical   [ 8 ]     manufacture   [  edit  ]   success of the cellulose fiber developed by de encouraged Fremery and Urban to investigate making artificial silk, which they named Silkimit ".   [ 4 ]   Fremery and Urban became involved in developing synthetic fiber  Glanzstoff  in the   [ 1 ]   Their process soon proved much safer than Chardonnet's nitrocellulose which was prone to explosions and fires, although it was still complex and costly in comparison to the viscose process patented in 1892 in   [ 4 ]    company had developed a process by 1897 that used rotating cylinders to stretch the fibers into finer filaments that could be used for making   [ 9 ]   They patented a version of the Despeissis process with the addition of a practical method for spinning the fiber. They filed the patent under the name of Dr.   [ a ]   so as not to alert their competitors. The patent was challenged but was   [ 3 ]   In Oberbruch in 1898 they established the first factory in Germany to economically produce artificial fiber, using a patent for manufacture of rayon made from cellulose in a copper-ammonia solution. The workforce had grown to 700 people within one year. In 1899 enterprises in France and Austria were licensed to produce rayon using the Fremery-Urban   [ 1 ]    and Urban moved their headquarters to Elberfeld now a suburb of Wuppertal .   [ 10 ]   Vereinigte Glanzstoff-Fabriken (VGF) was launched on 19 September 1899 with 2 million marks of capital, the Bergisch-Märkischen bank providing the   [ 11 ]   Fremery and the lawyer Hans Jordan (died 1923) were the main   [ 1 ]   Fremery and Urban, with the Alsatian textile chemist David Emil Bronnert (1868–1928), took out two more basic patents in   [ 11 ]    VGF's product was less versatile than rayon produced by the the scale of the operation allowed for reduced   [ 12 ]   Based largely on Fremery's leadership, the company quickly became a leader in artificial fiber manufacturing. In 1911 VGF bought the  von Donnersmarckschen Kunstseide- und  rayon factor in Stettin and acquired the patent rights for viscose   [ 1 ]   The company headed by Count Henckel von (1830–1916) had been the first in Germany to use the viscose process invented by Courtaulds in Britain. VGF quickly expanded viscose   [ 12 ]     years   [  edit  ]   1912 Fremery resigned from VGF board for health reasons.
