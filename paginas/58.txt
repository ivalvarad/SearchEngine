In 1922, the Communists were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics.

Stalin suppressed political opposition to him, committed the state ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created) and initiated a centrally As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization which laid the foundation for its victory in War and post-war dominance.

During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918–1929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example (shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and   [ 144 ]    government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers and were active during this time. Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director best work dates from this during Stalin's rule, Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, for example works. Many writers were imprisoned and   [ 145 ]    the of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. An underground dissident literature, known as  samizdat  developed during this late period.

The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact. It is the statistical artefact not of index number relativity (the Gerschenkron effect) but of misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure competitive value. The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalin's despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn  Zemskov's relatively favourable characterization of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism.
