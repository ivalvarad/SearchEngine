Snow was accompanied on the journey by (a friend of who had written of the Chinese communists, but whose presence was kept secret for many years. Snow had been preparing to write a book on the Communist movement in China for several years, and had even signed a contract at one point. However, his most important contribution was the interviews he conducted with the top leaders of the party. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports reaching the West of what was going on in the Other writers, such as had written in some detail of the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none had visited them or had first hand interviews with the new leadership which had emerged during the .

He was greeted with crowds of cadets and troops who shouted slogans of welcome, and Snow later recalled "the effect pronounced upon me was highly emotional." Over a period of ten days, Mao met with Snow and narrated his autobiography. Although Snow did not know it at the time, Mao was quite cautious in these interviews, and although claimed that he had been under no constraint, Snow made a number of revisions at the request of Mao or   [ 7 ]    he returned to Beiping in the fall, he wrote frantically. First he published a short account in Weekly then a series of publications in Chinese.

The goal of Indusco was to establish workers' cooperatives in areas not controlled by the Japanese, through which Chinese workers would be provided with steady employment, education, consumer and industrial goods, and the opportunity to manage their own farms and factories.

I remember, for example, talking one evening to a Japanese friend, a liberal-minded newspaper man who survived by keeping his views to himself, and whose name I withhold for his own protection. 'Yes, they are all true,' he unexpectedly admitted when I asked him about some atrocity reports, 'only the facts are actually worse than any story yet published.'

Snow met them again a year later in Chongqing and was reminded that "Japan was full of decent people like them who, if they had not had their craniums stuffed full of Sun goddess myths and other imperialist filth, and been forbidden access to 'dangerous thoughts,' and been armed by American and British hypocrites, could easily live in a civilized co-operative world if any of us could provide   [ 12 ]       [  edit  ]   before the United States entered World War II, in 1941, Snow toured Japanese-occupied areas of Asia and wrote his second major book, for about his   [ 2 ]   After writing the book, Snow and his wife returned to the United States, where they separated.   [ 13 ]   In April 1942 the Evening sent him abroad as a war correspondent. Snow traveled to India, China, and Russia to report on War from the perspective of those countries. In Russia he shared his observations on the of with the American Embassy. At times, Snow's defense of various undemocratic Allied governments were attacked as blatant war propaganda, not neutral journalistic observation, but Snow defended his reporting, this international cataclysm brought on by fascists it is no more possible for any people to remain neutral than it is for a man surrounded by bubonic plague to remain 'neutral' toward the rat population. Whether you like it or not, your life as a force is bound either to help the rats or hinder them. Nobody can be immunized against the germs of   [ 14 ]    1944, Snow was wavering on the question of whether Mao and the Chinese Communists were actually "agrarian democrats," rather than dedicated communists bent on totalitarian   [ 14 ]   His 1944 book, On Our emphasized their role in the fight against fascism. In a speech, he described Mao and the Communist Chinese as a progressive force who desired a democratic, free China. Writing for   Snow stated that the Chinese Communists "happen to have renounced, years ago now, any intention of establishing communism [in China] in the near   [ 14 ]   After the war, Snow retreated from this view of the Chinese communists as a democratic working as a correspondent in Russia, he wrote three short books about Russia's role in World War II and in world affairs: on Our (1944); Pattern of Soviet (1945); and, Must Have (1947). In 1949 Snow divorced Helen Foster and married his second wife, Lois   [ 2 ]    of his relationships with communists and his highly favorable treatment of them as a war correspondent, Snow became an object of suspicion following World War II. During the he was questioned by the FBI and asked to disclose the extent of his relationship with the Communist Party. In published articles, Snow lamented what he saw as the one-sided, conservative, and anti-communist mood of the United States. Later in the 1950s, he published two more books about China: Notes on Red (1957), a collection of previously unused China material of interest to China scholars; and, to the (1958), an autobiographical account of his experiences in China before 1949. During the 1950s, Snow found it difficult to make a living through his writing, and he decided to leave the United States. He moved with his wife to Switzerland in 1959, but remained an American   [ 2 ]     to   [  edit  ]   returned to China in 1960 and 1964, interviewed and traveled extensively, and talked with many people.

Some China historians have judged Snow's writing very positively. K. praised Snow's reporting for giving the West the first articulate account of the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership, which he called "disastrously prophetic". Writing thirty years after the first publication of Star Over Fairbank stated that the book had "stood the test of time... both as a historical record and as an indication of a   [ 18 ]    historians have been more critical of Snow. and biography,  The Unknown  describes Snow as a Mao spokesman and accuses him of supplying myths, asserting that he lost his objectivity to such an extent that he presented a romanticized view of communist   [ 19 ]    Mirsky, a critical voice, stated that what Snow did in the 1930s was "to describe the Chinese Communists before anyone else, and thus score a world-class scoop." Of his reporting in 1960, however, he says that Snow "went much further than those who reckoned that Mao and his comrades would take power." He contented himself with assurances from Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong that while there was a food problem, it was being dealt with successfully," which was not true, and "had Snow still been the reporter he had been in the 1930s he would have discovered it."   [ 20 ]   In  A  a work sympathetic to Mao, Lee Feigon criticizes Snow's account for its inaccuracies, but praises for being "[the] seminal portrait of Mao" and relies on Snow's work as a critical reference throughout the   [ 21 ]     Works   [  edit  ]    China: Modern Chinese Short    Star Over  (various editions, London, New York, 1937–1944).
