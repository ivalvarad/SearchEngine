Symptoms normally present themselves after one to three days and are usually no longer present after a week. The frequency of urges to defecate, the large volume of liquid feces passed, and the presence of mucus, pus and blood depends on the pathogen that is causing the disease. Temporary can occur. In some caustic occasions severe abdominal pain, fever shock and delirium can all be   [ 1 ]      [ 4 ]      [ 5 ]      [ 6 ]    extreme cases, dysentery patients may pass over one litre of fluid per hour. More often, individuals will complain of nausea and frequent watery and usually foul-smelling diarrhea accompanied by mucus and blood rectal pain, and fever Vomiting rapid weight-loss, and generalized sometimes also accompany dysentery. On rare occasions, the amoebic parasite will invade the body through the bloodstream and beyond the In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the brain lungs and the liver .   [ 7 ]     Mechanism   [  edit  ]   results from viral infections, bacterial infections, or parasitic infestations. These pathogens typically reach the after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general the result is damage to the intestinal lining, leading to the immune This can cause elevated temperature, painful spasms of the intestinal muscles cramping swelling due to water leaking from capillaries of the intestine edema and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called cytokines they release to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases the entry of pathogenic organisms into the microorganisms – for example, bacteria of the genus  Shigella  – secrete substances known as cytotoxins which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Viruses directly attack the intestinal cells, taking over their metabolic machinery to make copies of themselves, which leads to cell of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to "diarrhea with visible   [ 8 ]   Others define the term more   [ 9 ]   These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific    [  edit  ]   article:  caused by amoebiasis an infection by the amoeba   ,   [ 10 ]   which is found mainly in tropical areas, is known as amoebic   [ 11 ]   Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to potentially fatal, . amoebas inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebas is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor; for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically, it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water. If another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoeba. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer. After entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst will travel down into the stomach. The amoebas inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst will travel to the intestines where it will break open and release the amoebas, causing the infection. The amoebas can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins    [  edit  ]   may also be caused by shigellosis an infection by bacteria of the genus  Shigella  ,   [ 12 ]   and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow  Escherichia may also cause a dysentery [     ]   Diagnosis   [  edit  ]   clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination.

Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the changing number of amoeba, which changes   [ 7 ]     can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential and .   [ 7 ]     Treatment   [  edit  ]   is managed by maintaining fluids by using rehydration If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for intravenous fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an amoebicidal drug to kill the parasite and an antibiotic to treat any associated bacterial shigella is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable — usually less than a week. If the shigella is severe, antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX may be useful. However, many strains of shigella are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or dysentery is often treated with two antimicrobial drug such as metronidazole and paromomycin or iodoquinol .   [ 13 ]     Prognosis   [  edit  ]   correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within ten days, and most individuals will achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment. If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease. Extreme dehydration can prolong recovery and significantly raises the risk for serious   [ 14 ]     Epidemiology   [  edit  ]   WHO estimates that there are 80 million cases and 700,000 deaths from Shigellosis   [ 15 ]   Amebiasis infects over 50 million people each year, of whom 50,000   [ 16 ]     and   [  edit  ]   seed, leaves, and bark of the kapok tree have been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples of the rain-forest regions in West-Central Africa, and South East Asia to treat this   [ 17 ]      [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]     was marketed throughout America and Europe from 1946 as an immunostimulatory aid in the treatment of gut and urinary tract diseases such as Rotavirus and   [ 20 ]   but declined in popularity after the introduction of cheap consumer antibiotics, despite causing less chance of allergic reaction and significantly lower toxicity to normal gut    [  edit  ]    1216 – King of died of dysentery at on 18 October   [ 21 ]     1422 – King V of died suddenly from dysentery in 1422.

For example, Shigella is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. Currently, no licensed vaccine targeting Shigella exists. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies. Several vaccine candidates are currently in various phases of research and development, including a number of ongoing clinical   [ 31 ]     References   [  edit  ]       a       b     " Dysentery at  Medical       ^     "Dysentery" who.int  Retrieved .          ^   Diarrhea: Dysentery p.     ^    HL (1978).
