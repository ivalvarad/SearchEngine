If the source is deemed reliable, and DYK rules do not require more sources in this case, the situation is as simple as it can be. If it is necessary to add aditional (German-language) citations verifying basic facts such as her existance/name, country of origin, name of her husband, possibly year of death, I suppose can do that despite not speaking German. I honestly do not see the point of using redundant lower grade sources other than to formally satisfy a requirement. The article does not have the potential to reach GA status, but it is DYK material. Surtsicna talk 22:44, 17 October 2015 (UTC) strikes me that if someone died over 600 years ago but is still being written about, they are clearly notable. The thesis also refers to a 16th century historian who studied her.

The main problem I have is that most of the content is cited to the TV episode itself, which is a bit weak. I'd prefer a synopsis of the programme or a feature on it, such as the   or ITV's own website, particularly for the key word "berating" in the hook (and ejection from what exactly?)

The remaining sourcing problem is that there are no sources to indicate the broadcasting details; this does need clearing up before this nom can be passed. There also seem to be a lot more sources available (from extensive research I've done by typing "safeword ITV" into Google; go me, Queen of Research! ) Other non-DYK problems: "roulette" is not right, "carousel" could be but I haven't seen the show so I can't say for certain; there's no indication in the episode list of which of the guests were the targets; and it is unclear if the seven episodes are the complete series.

Thanks. BlueMoonset talk 20:34, 13 October 2015    Two and half months down the line this nomination seems to be going nowhere, mainly because the article is inadequately sourced to reliable secondary coverage about the programme. One news article does not make a TV programme on a minor TV channel notable. The page is almost entirely unsourced at the moment, suggesting it is more of a fan page than an encylopedic article. I notice there is an edit dispute currently, with an IP editor removing all of the primary sources. The hook is poor too, it should at least say "British television game show" or even "ITV2 game show", but that is minor in comparison with the major unresolved issues with the article itself.

The DYK criteria requires an in-line cite no later than the end of the sentence that contains the hook fact. Also, now that I'm looking at this more closely, the article appears to say in the lead that Hamza narrated this Dua, which would contradict the hook fact. This apparent contradiction would need to be resolved before this hook runs (or the hook updated, if you intended for al-Thumali to be in the hook). ~  Rob    Talk  10:07, 18 August 2015  @ : nominated two issues.

As for ALT1, the fact that Zayn al-Abidin invocated it is in the article and cited, but you would need to add the fact that he was the fourth Shia Imam to the article with a cite. ~  Rob    Talk  10:19, 19 August 2015  @ : you clear to the meaning of in-line citation?

The final paragraphs of the "Chain of authority" and "Reception" are particularly opaque. I would like to strongly recommend that "invocated" not be used in the ALT1 hook (and article, since the hook is taken directly from it), since the verb "invocate" is listed by dictionaries as "archaic" and there is probably a better way to phrase it so people won't stumble over an obsolete word. BlueMoonset talk 20:53, 22 August 2015 my point of view, this is barely English. It needs serious work and anyone who was involved with accepting it for main page inclusion should take a second look.

The text is written neutrally with no copyright vios detected. Image is fair use. QPQ not needed. ALT1 has inline citations, although one citation appears to be the text to the supplication rather than a reference to the fact that it was invoked by Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin. The second citation links to a site in a language I do not speak, so I could not confirm the citation. Perhaps someone else should double check this point. Also, in a discussion previously, there was a question about whether the word "invocated" should be used in ALT1. That hasn't been yet addressed. SojoQ talk 20:25, 15 September 2015 first citation requires you to join the site to download the cited document so I couldn't confirm it; the second one has the information in the hook at the top except it only mentions dawn ("the time of beginning of the fast"), so the hook should be altered is that cite is relied on; not sure how far any of the sites are deemed reliable sources though.

I think it should be either quoted and attributed, or replaced with a more neutral I'm missing something (very possible, as I am not well-versed in Islam) but the source cited for the phrase "Imam al-Sajjad, the fourth Shia Imam" seems to identify 'Ali Zain al-Abidin as the fourth Imam.

I searched the book for "morning" and "evening" but could not find substantiation of the second source cited for the timing of the invocation of the supplication seems to be in Persian.

If that makes sense. talk 20:38, 20 September 2015 As I have been editing some articles relating to and Hinduism itself recently, I also want to join the conversation. I certainly believe the Varaha Upanishad deserves a DYK, as it is such an important work, whether you are religious or not. In my opinion, the current DYK info is a bit too general to by catchy on its own. And as it has been pointed out it might not make much sense to people without much "inside" knowledge on the subject.

I must say that I am surprised it only dates to the 13th-16th century, as most other Upanishads are 3,000 years old. Or am I completely off on that one too? I better check up on all this. It might be, that the source you writes from Nvvchar, is a compilation with some added verses from that period, while the original text is much older. I dont know and I better discuss it on the articles own TalkPage when I have done some proper research on it. yes the Upanishads that are viewed as part of the Vedas, are generally 3,000 years old, written in 900-600 BCE. I have now learned, that there are a plethora of more recent so-called Upanishads also. But as only some groups view them as part of the Vedas, they are often called "the sectarian Upanishads" in scholarly terms. Guess you learn something new every day:-) I have moved this particular discussion to the proper TalkPage for now. RhinoMind talk 02:29, 23 September 2015 it was I who suggested the ALT DYK, I think its a great idea:-), but could we perhaps sharpen the DYK further with the addition that it was "the first text to describe ..."?

Then he needs to make sure it's mentioned that way and sourced in the talk 13:46, 23 September 2015  @ RhinoMind : @ Maile66 : I propose this  ALT5 hook ... that the   describes Samsara (cycle of birth, life and death) as part of one’s karma or deed and is stated to be a prolonged swapna or    Nvvchar   14:34, 23 September 2015 my opinion counts, I think ALT5 is too long and even more complicated than the original DYK. And Samsara is described by so many other texts, Varaha does not stand out in this respect. For a DYK, I think we should pick something that is unusual and at the same time special for Varaha Upanishad. Perhaps Nvvchars original hook is the best idea after all? Just my thoughts on this. RhinoMind talk 17:24, 23 September 2015 (UTC)  @ Maile66 : I would prefer the original hook, as also suggested by RhinoMind I am proposing it again with slight  ALT6 that in the   Varaha (pictured) enlightens sage Ribhu who attained godhood by austerities, on all scriptural  Nvvchar   04:10, 25 September 2015     Reviewer needed to check ALT6. talk 12:25, 25 September 2015    I essentially re-checked this article against all the criteria. It does need some clean-up, but nothing major, and main page exposure hopefully attract some editors willing to copy-edit the article. I'm approving as it meets the hook criteria and seems the most satisfactory one reached after long discussion. I've taken the liberty of striking Alts 4 and 5, and moving 6 out so that it is more visible for the prepping   3family6     to   |   what I have   19:34, 3 October 2015    Sorry, but "austerities on Hindu texts" makes no sense. I haven't had time to check this nom thoroughly, but at the very least the hook will need rephrasing. Gatoclass talk 14:11, 6 October 2015  Gatoclass it's actually "austerities, on Hindu texts." Ribhu, who practiced austerities, is being enlightened on all Hindu texts, no Ribhu practiced austerities on Hindu texts. Even so, maybe "who attained godhood by austerities" could be reworded to "who attained godhood through austerity" or "practicing   3family6     to   |   what I have   14:39, 6 October 2015 you for the explanation, but quite honestly, "enlightened on all Hindu texts" doesn't make much sense to me either, especially given that "enlightened" usually has a more specific meaning in this context. Again, I am going to have to take a closer look at the article and its sources before drawing any further conclusions. Gatoclass talk 14:50, 6 October 2015 this thread still active? Gatoclass Yes, reading the text carefully, it all makes sense, as 3family6 explains. But I can see that the phrasing is easy to misunderstand, and it might ease things, if the commas are simply replaced by dashes. Like that in the Varaha (pictured) enlightens sage Ribhu - who attained godhood by austerities - on all Hindu enlightens can mean many things in a religious context, but here it simply means enlightenment, as it is used in the context of education. Varaha made sure Ribhu understood the Hindu scriptures. Nothing  - I would not endorse this, although it seems a very small thing. Austerity - in Christianity in particular - has a very specific meaning. In a Hindu context there are many "austerities" to work with. They are mainly summed up in the Yamas These Yamas are somewhat similiar to the Ten Commandments in Christianeity, so the word "austerities" has a much broader meaning than how the word "austerity" is usually understood in a western cultural context. With just a superficial understanding of Hinduism this aspect is clear. Not trying to be condescenting, just stating and explaining researching. Nvvchar has made a great contribution by writing up a summary of this important text in English from the sanskrit version. I am not sure there is any English translation of this text available anywhere. If you know of, or has access to one, the article can be greatly improved if you put in a link or  RhinoMind talk 20:34, 8 October 2015  @ Gatoclass : Nvvchar and RhinoMind Perhaps a more interesting hook would be "... that the considers being born a human male Brahmin a blessing not easily achieved?" This would mean that a citation would need to be added to the corresponding passage in the   3family6     to   |   what I have   03:06, 9 October 2015 for the delay in returning to this - I was surprised by the length of the article and of the upanishad itself, which has put me off a bit and I haven't found time to look more closely at it yet. I think Rhinomind's suggested fix for ALT6 would probably work, and 3family6's suggested alt would also probably be acceptable assuming it can be verified. Gatoclass talk 09:22, 9 October 2015 (UTC)  Gatoclass RhinoMind and 3family6 I have fixed reference to ALT6 suggested by which is in chapter II hymns 5 (b) -7 (a). I have also added the original Sanskrit version of the Upanishad but there is no verbatim translation of this text in   Nvvchar   10:28, 13 October 2015    Having taken a closer look at this, I can't verify ALT6, which looks to me like a possible misreading of the underlying text. 3family6 suggested alt might work, except that the text uses the term "Brahmana" rather than "Brahmin" and I don't know if they are the same thing.

However, ALTs 3 through 5 are very confusing in their intro; ALT1 was acceptable in that regard, but these three are not. You also might want to consider putting the second clause ("before his demise at his home in Shadikhan") first, which would allow the rest of the hook to run without interruption ("that before his demise at his home in Shadikhan, Pakistani politician and ex-colonel Shuja Khanzada fought/served/commanded..."). ALT4 and ALT5 also end with "throughout his military career", which don't make sense in the context of a single assignment from that career. Finally, while I realize you were trying to address the feelings by one of the authors of the articles that the initial hooks were "morbid and disrespectful", the euphemistic phrase "his demise at his home" makes it sound like he died of a fall, not from assassins' bombs. If the line in the lead of the Shuja Khanzada article, Home Minister in 2014, Khanzada spearheaded the campaign against terrorism and sectarian militancy in could be sourced, that fact might make an effective hook in tandem with the attack.

If people want to know the meaning of Thalys, it will be there in the bolded article. I've also relabeled the second ALT3 as ALT4, and revised the death/injury clauses, since they had wording problems and couldn't have passed as is. I'm not sure why you've gone from "six" to "several", so I left that unchanged, although the lack of a firm number makes the hook inherently less interesting.

Otherwise, it might be worthwhile doing a google search for "world's first model railroad" to try and find further verification.

George Brown  Co., of Connecticut is credited with making the first known self-propelled American model train in 1856.

The source definitely does not confirm that the railway of the Prince Imperial was the first documented model railway in the world. Nor does it support a number of other statements in the article, a good part of which – through no fault of the nominator – appears to consist of speculation or WP:OR compounded by poor understanding of the source (for example, the engine is described in the source as being 50 cm wide, but the Wikipedia articles (en, de, da) give that as a length).

BlueMoonset talk 21:26, 11 October 2015    Although it appears that the claim in ALT1 is supported by an offline source (and referenced by an inline citation in the article), I think there are a few other reasons why this article is likely ineligible at the moment. A2 states that block quotations should not be counted when determining article length. If you exclude the large block quotation in this article, it falls below the required 1500 characters. Additionally, rule D6 says an article is likely to be rejected if there are in the article. As of this moment, I count four dispute tags in this article (and one more could arguably be placed on the unsourced sentence at the end of the "Historic documents" sentence). I think this hook could make for a very interesting DYK, but the article first needs to be expanded and the citation issues still need to be resolved.

SojoQ talk 21:04, 17 October 2015 new at this, so please forgive me if I have strayed too far from the sources in search of a hook. I interpreted yadvashem.org and the Sophie Koper interview to support the claims in both hooks, but now I see that the claim Koper "risked his life" is interpretative and not specifically supported by the cited sources alone. I regret, however, I don't understand your objection to the claim in the other hook: Koper helped rescue Jews from the ghetto, one of whom he later married. Can you tell me what I'm missing? I'm really not trying to be obnoxious; just trying to understand so I can avoid these mistakes, and regardless the outcome of the DYK nomination, I would like to improve the article as much as possible. Thank you for your patience and assistance. Gregory talk 11:21, 18 October 2015 feel confident the nomination will pass--the hook just needs to be sorted. It could just be my interpretation of the hook rules. I'm used to hooks relating more directly with what's actually written in the text. For example, the sentence: "Once hostilities ended, Koper married Sophie Margulies, who had also fought in the Warsaw Uprising as a nurse, treating Polish Home Army casualties during the battle" refers to his marriage to Sophie Margulies, but doesn't mention she was also someone he rescued from the Ghetto, which came from another part of of the page. Likewise, the sentence that talks about about his personal risk doesn't specifically mention the rescuing Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto, although that was mentioned earlier on the page as well. The citations on the page, overall, are fine, I just thought the info in the hooks needed to be all in one sentence with appropriate inline citations. Perhaps a more experienced editor can weigh in. I definitely don't want to hold up the nomination and defer to a more expert opinion.

Will that work for a green talk 19:08, 2 October 2015 it won't. We can't rely on automated tools like Copyvio Detector to determine close paraphrasing, because they aren't "smart" enough to see what humans can - phrases that are close in wording or structure but not identical to the source. Another example of this from Shelby Gem Factory: "These are chemically and physically indistinguishable of those unearthed. The man-made gemstones have a nearly flawless composition, because the factory controls the ingredients and cooking temperature. It is very rare to find flawless natural gems" vs "which are chemically and physically identical to stones dug from the ground. “Most of the gems we make are nearly flawless, because we control the ingredients and the cooking temperature,” Larry says. “It is rare to find a flawless natural ruby".

Jakob talk )   23:02, 15 October 2015 problem with ALT1, Jakec is that it just isn't interesting. Who cares that a name was misspelled on an official document one time? It's a yawn as a hook, made worse by the fact that it's a wordy yawn. Also, we have already featured at least one other hook using essentially the same fact. I think ALT2 is a lot more interesting and I see no problem with it; it's a fact that the USGS were recommending the adoption of the spelling "Boile Run" 95 years after its first documented use. Gatoclass talk 08:50, 16 October 2015 (UTC) is not entirely accurate; it makes it sound like the name was in question the whole time, which it wasn't. And we don't know that 1874 is the first documented use of Boile Run. It's just the first that can be found from publicly available online sources.  Jakob talk )   11:17, 16 October 2015 (UTC)  Jakec it's not from "publicly available online sources", it's from a 1965 document, long before there was any such thing as "online". And that USGS document states that the name has been in use "approx. 95 years" and cites an 1874 map, so yes, the 1874 map must be the first documented use. I guess you have a point about the "still in question" phrase, however. Try this instead: ALT3: ... that government officials recommended adopting the name   for a tributary of the Susquehanna 95 years after its first documented use?

Gatoclass talk 14:27, 6 October 2015 for not following up on this one sooner. Both alts are awkward in my opinion and inaccurate, I don't think either are acceptable. The original hook looks viable in terms of fact but again is a bit awkwardly expressed - does "told about" mean "introduced to" (ie Wollstonecraft)? And I don't think you can say she "told about" the nature of misogyny either, as if she's an impeccable authority - she merely had an opinion and wrote about it. So I think this hook at least needs some clarification. Gatoclass talk 07:02, 18 October 2015 Berlepsch did indeed introduce Wollstonecraft to German readers (the article says only "discussed" so that would need to be clarified) then I think the original hook could be reworded to something  ALT3: ... that aristocrat  von  wrote about women‍ '​s rights and misogyny and introduced German readers to the work of Gatoclass talk 07:08, 18 October 2015 you telling us about this or writing about it? I'm not sure there is a difference. I'm quite happy with either or even if you are "introducing" your view to us. I presume this difference is important and I'm happy with any of these very similar interpretations. This alt doesn't address Gerda's objections (who can read de:wiki) however which I feel have been ignored. Victuallers talk 14:24, 18 October 2015 (UTC) think the difference is that "told" can mean a lot of different things and have different connotations, whereas "introduced" has a more precise meaning. However, you didn't confirm for me that Ms. Berlepsch did actually introduce Germans to Wollstonecraft - the article still only says she "discussed" W. for German readers - any chance you could clarify that in the article? Regarding Gerda's comments, they weren't really objections, rather suggestions as to how the article might be improved, which are beyond the scope of this process, as I think the article already meets the criteria. We really only need to confirm the hook at this point. Gatoclass talk 14:48, 18 October 2015 (UTC) said " I though again about the hook. Can you add a hint at early writing on women's rights, for those who don't know Wollstonecraft and misogyny?". This is not about the article and it is the reason why the hooks were written. The original hook said "told". I would have thought that translations might be useful for introducing a writer to German readers but maybe she was just discussing/telling/saying/writing. If you want to insist on Alt3 then I suggest you change it to the word you like. I think introduce could have read re-introduce but discuss will do. Victuallers talk 16:55, 18 October 2015 (UTC) added "womens rights" to the hook (and also "aristocrat" as I think it adds to the interest). How does it look now? Gatoclass talk 10:12, 19 October 2015 (UTC) watching, on vacation:) please don't change hooks which have caused comments, because it makes the discussion hard to follow. "Aristocrat" is redundant for readers who know that the "von" in her name stands for that.

Is "introduced" now in the article and sourced? talk 17:12, 19 October 2015 (UTC) would you prefer to see in the hook, misogyny or womens rights? Regarding the "introduced", the article states that discussed various writers for German readers including particularly Mary Wollstonecraft.[1] She notes her similar role in raising these subjects for the first time in If she "raised these subjects for the first time in German" then she introduced them to Gatoclass talk 09:45, 20 October 2015 (UTC) rights better than a word I never heard before, - but that's just me. You might convince me that it is a catchy term, and the source indeed says that she gave what she fought that name. As for "first time", I can't access the offline source, and the article says that she regarded herself as the first, which makes "first" not a fact. I like the phrase in source 2, "fighting against the prejudice that wants to grant women neither a will of their own nor the courage to express it", but see that it's long. talk 10:28, 20 October 2015 (UTC) to confirm the off line source says that she re-introduced as German readers may have forgotten Wollstonecraft - I think this is Gerda's point.

Pleased to see Gerda is involved as I feel we are sending the wrong message when we re-open a review by a competent reviewer.

Regarding the title: It is unclear why you're calling them "pendant portraits", as they are full-length portraits. I didn't see that term in the sources. Perhaps just "Portraits" would suffice? Regarding the hook facts, these need to be stated and cited in the article. The first fact, that it broke a record for the most expensive pair of pendant wedding portraits ever, doesn't appear in the article. The second fact, that the purchase price broke a record for the most expensive works by Rembrandt appears in the article but not in the source. No QPQ necessary for nominator with less than 5 DYKs. Image is PD. Yoninah talk 23:09, 15 October 2015 thanks for your comments! The word "pendant" in the case of paintings refers to the fact that the paintings form a pair (a "painting series", but not a larger series than 2) and are meant to hang together. The supporting articles about the paintings individually quote the expert Hofstede de Groot who refers to them explicitly as pendants of each other. Though the word "pendant" may be missing from the current sources in this article, I don't see a need to include a specific reference for this word, as it is so common in this context. The NYtimes source does say that the only comparable Rembrandt is the Aristotle which sold for $2.3 million in 1961. That makes it a pretty safe bet to say this is the most expensive pair and the most paid individually. Not sure what else you can compare it to. This is also the only entry in the List of most expensive paintings, which I linked to. Without access to insurance premiums we can't show the actual market value of others (though I imagine the reason these have appeared on the market in March is due to this enormously expensive show of Late Rembrandt in the Rijksmuseum this year. Jane talk 08:23, 16 October 2015 (UTC)  Comment - Jane is quite correct. Article is good to go, although I wouldnt mention "record-breaking" in the lead image, which also could be enlarged.   Ceoil talk 15:32, 17 October 2015 (UTC)    Thank you for your input, @ Ceoil : but it is inappropriate to take over another editor's review and approve the article before I could even respond. I hope to respond to Jane shortly. Yoninah talk 18:08, 17 October 2015  @ Jane023 : OK, I understand now what "pendant portraits" are. But I don't see the proper inline cites in place. Would you mind pointing out where it says in the article that the sale broke a record for the most expensive pair of pendant wedding portraits ever, and which source you're citing? would you point out where it says in footnote 1, source that you're citing, where it broke a record for the most expensive works by Rembrandt ? Thank you, Yoninah talk 20:30, 17 October 2015 source that mentions that when the of Catrina sold earlier this year, it was a record price for the artist. However, three weeks ago, in an unusual move, the Rijksmuseum and the Louvre in Paris agreed jointly to buy a pair of Rembrandt portraits of Maerten Soolmans and his wife Oopjen Coppit (1634) from the Eric de Rothschild collection, for €160m for the pair". Ceoil talk 21:01, 17 October 2015 you, @ Ceoil : for adding sources for the record-breaking Rembrandt part. Yoninah talk 21:05, 17 October 2015 Yoninah - this has made headlines in a lot of the trade mags in last weeks. More available. Ceoil talk 21:07, 17 October 2015 thanks for adding those (quite interesting) references! I moved the NYTimes article ref up too. Yoninah, I think that indeed the Catrina Hooghsaet (1657) portrait and its proposed price of 50 million euros is proof enough that Oopjen's portrait is the most expensive female portrait by Rembrandt, but again, it is more the fact that these Rembrandts don't come on the market at all, and certainly not as a pair. That fact in and of itself means it is a record, since the art market in general has exploded since the 1980s and there have been no Rembrandt wedding pendants sold together since that time. Let me know if you want me to expand it a bit about the Catrina Hooghsaet portrait (could use its own article!) -- I am especially intrigued to read that it came on the market after being lent out to the Rijksmuseum, which just goes to prove my theory that the insurance premiums have gone up so high that it is maybe getting too expensive to hold such paintings if you don't have the paying public to help with the costs of ownership. Jane talk 21:26, 17 October 2015 to mention that in general portraits of women are cheaper than portraits of men, and so the pendants are probably valued at 100/60 rather than 80/80 but we will never know for sure, and the Hooghsaet price helps with that.

The proposed hook is worse, essentially using the words of Adémar de Chabannes to call Al-Haqim the Antichrist. The article's topic is a complex, nuanced, and sensitive event. The article itself is not; I will not approve it for DYK. talk 02:32, 8 October 2015  Comment Excuse me, but the entire of Wikipedia is Western/Judeo-Christian biased accounting! What do you think our University system is based on? There are no Fatimid perspectives, they all likely killed Al-Hakim. We don't give Hitler perspective on the holocaust because no-one (or a negligible minority) support his view and think that was a good thing to have done. I don't think you have re-read the article carefully enough to notice that the "desecration" extended beyond the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at all and with that sort of neglect request another reviewer's attention to this article. I have however changed the hook on your advice to make it suitable. talk 08:12, 8 October 2015 is built on consensus; you are welcome to seek a second opinion, although I assure you that I examined the article, its claims, and its sourcing quite thoroughly. An appropriately balanced, neutral article on the topic would need to address scholars' opinions of Al-Haqim's motivations (which will probably need to address his shifting religious allegiances), such as concerns that the was [3] or that the destruction was potentially taken as a consequence of the complex during the [4] A neutral article will also need to take a more measured approach to the chain of events connecting the 1009 destruction of the church to the First Crusade. probably needs to be addressed along with Adémar, and context needs to be provided for their writings (Adémar especially was prone to hyperbole or outright fabrication). The First Crusade's causes were more complex and nuanced; indeed, Al-Haqim was long dead and the church rebuilt before the Crusades were even conceived of. Not all scholars agree whether its destruction was even mentioned by Urban II at [5] And, finally, it goes without saying that a neutral article would require neutral language This is simply not Hitler and the Holocaust. talk 14:16, 8 October 2015 for these helpful pointers. It is more complex than the Holocaust. I have made an attempt to incorporate a lot of this information with a new motivations section and clarified the crusades. talk 21:07, 8 October 2015    The article is much improved from the state at its original DYK nomination, but I am still not comfortable approving this for DYK. I retain the belief that the title is problematic, and that some of the phrasing (especially, but not limited to, "abomination of desolation") is far from neutral. It remains my opinion that this is not suitable, but the nominator has requested a third party reviewer, and I have no objection to someone else giving the article due consideration. talk 14:10, 14 October 2015 you for your valuable contribution Squeamish. Much appreciated. I have taken the of topic up on the talk page and further discussion is welcome there, not limited to that but other possibly problematic phrasing I am open to address. I understand your concerns about title and am open to discussion about that, also the hook. This article has become a bit of a Whodunit case since I started it. After a lot of researching it seems likely in my opinion that bi-Amr did likely have a Christian mother and did likely execute his uncle Arsenius, Patriarch of Jerusalem as part of the "desecration" for the Holy Fire fraud on the suggestion of the disenchanted Christian monk John, making the whole matter a lot more involved than generally understood, prior to writing the article. I think this clarification of multiple complicity actually presents a great message of peace right now, with everything going on with Shi'ite Muslims and Christians in Syria. Perhaps a revised hook and some advice could put that message across on the main page to your better satisfaction? talk 15:49, 14 October 2015       Hours (Morgan  or      Book of that the parchment of the 15th-century  Book of  (pictured) was presoaked in black ink, creating a dark, mournful visual tone appealing to high ranking members of the ruling Burgundian ... that the parchment of the 15th-century  Book of  (pictured) appealing to the high ranking member of the ruling  Reviewed Gott in allen Landen, BWV   expanded by Ceoil talk and talk Nominated by Ceoil talk at 04:13, 10 October 2015     expansion enough, long enough, inline citations and refs checks, interesting and factual hook.

Mhhossein talk 18:05, 12 October 2015 (UTC) this article can be extended at any length, there are 25-30 sectors in which India gets FDI, one can make subsection on each sector and can write 2-4 paras on each. There are 25-50 nations who invest in India, whole details can be written on this, as far as history is concerned, history of FDI since independence of India or even before that can be written. So this article can become as long as we want. But this much iprovement may takes week, so I nominated it within time because it was having 1500 characters and was summarizinf thigngs.

BlueMoonset talk 22:51, 12 October 2015 through the conclusions of Stenroos  DePreist, I agree with what @ BlueMoonset : notes, @ GrammarFascist : it looks like you missread the Genus Baeomyces as the species on page 1557 of the  Kev    min  § 02:55, 13 October 2015 am more than willing to accept that I may have misread something in the densely-technical sources I used. I like science, but I am not a scientist by training. That said, in reviewing the source, I found three statements I had used to build the article. Two are unambiguous, I think — "Our data suggest that Baeomyces rufus and Dibaeis baeomyces (syn. Baeomyces roseus) are phylogenetically distant and more closely related to taxa from other orders and suborders than to each other." and "Siphula ceratites and Thamnolia vermicularis form a monophyletic assemblage together with Dibaeis baeomyces." — and seem to support what's in the article I created. Then there is "Pertusaria trachythallina of the Lecanorales forms a monophyletic group with Gyalecta ulmi of the Gyalectales, Baeomyces and Dibaeis baeomyces of the Leotiales." (emphasis added). The inclusion of B. rufus in that sentence contradicts the rest of the article, so I was taking it as a misprint. Shall I perhaps add a quote= parameter to the citation to clarify where the information is coming for the quotation marks, I will take them out. Thanks for reassuring me they were not needed, Kevmin and BlueMoonset I also struck the original hook since it only applied to the first article.   Grammar Fascist    contribs     talk  04:07, 13 October 2015   ┌  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ┘  *   Initial review of   article new enough, long enough, and well referenced. No obvious problems with it, and the hook is cited, and checks out. We still await clarification of the monophyly paragraph in   due to probable missreading of the source as identified above. Also "phylogentically distant" doesn't need quotes  Kev    min  § 03:00, 13 October 2015  @ GrammarFascist : I come to the same conclusion as you on the one sentence being out of place given the consistency of the article on the unrelated nature of the two species. I would clarify in the article that there is some confusion on the nature of the relation and see if there is any new papers that clarify.  Kev    min  § 22:34, 13 October 2015  @ Kevmin : It's a relief to read that you don't think I misread the article after all. I have added a footnote to the   article explaining the apparent contradiction in the Stenroos and DePriest paper. I also found and added a third study that also established Baeomyces and Dibaeis as distinct genera. I don't think a similar note is necessary in   as that article only asserts that was found not to belong to genus Baeomyces and says nothing further about the relatedness of the two species.   Grammar Fascist    contribs     talk  00:02, 14 October 2015 you ought to omit the monophyletic group material altogether, if you believe the source is incorrect, rather than include the parts you think are correct and omit those you don't (albeit with explanation). There is no obligation to include every fact in a source; eventually there will be further publication and a more clear statement of the facts. BlueMoonset talk 15:28, 14 October 2015 was an excellent suggestion, BlueMoonset and I have followed it. Reference to monophyly has been removed, along with the corresponding footnote.

I knew the others didn't meet the standards but thought they all had to be submitted because they all appear in the hook. The graphic that accompanies the submission is a cover from another Temperance song, not the Stephen Foster song. The text on the graphic is quite amusing and says something like "the lips that touch liquor shall never touch mine" but it is not the temperance song he wrote. The graphic is meant to represent an example of a Temperance song, not the Stephen Foster song.

Further, the RS of Xinhua and Trend News Agency merits scrutiny. LavaBaron talk 11:59, 18 October 2015 sorry, but can any one explain what LavaBaron really means? The hook is so interesting to be repeated by numerous reliable sources, one could easily get it by a simple search through those news outlets some of which are used as references to this article.

Mhhossein talk 12:57, 18 October 2015 (UTC) the tone of this article presupposes Iranian ballistic missiles are offensive weapons, when there is a wide body of contention (e.g. Ken Waltz, et. al.) that advances the idea that Iranian ballistic missiles are a necessary power balancing technology (Ali Akbar Velayati, himself, has referred to them as "defensive weapons"). One-third of the article relies on a quote from an IDF official expressing fear of a "surprise attack," which - without any balancing statement - simply plays into an Islamophobic trope.

In fact, all three images have licensing issues to a greater or lesser extent. The first two are both licensed PD-US as works published before 1923, but there needs to be evidence that they were actually published and not just taken prior to that date (I'm pretty sure these are both publicity photos, which would clearly have been distributed and, thus, published, but that should be clarified). The third image, which is requested as part of this DYK, is licensed PD-old-80 but this is not sufficient to demonstrate the artwork is in the public domain the United Because this image may have been cropped somewhat from the actual artwork, it is not safe to assume that it did not comply with the initial copyright registration formalities in 1926 when it was created; however, since Robert Henri died shortly after painting it, it is very unlikely that a copyright renewal was filed in 1954. That would, at a minimum, qualify it for but you will need to check the 1954 of Copyright to be certain of that. talk 17:43, 15 October 2015 you are setting some difficult problems. I'll answer the three of them in the order you raised them @ :  regards the hook - please suggest an alt that suits you. It makes sense to me, but I don't understand your suggested change that addresses the point you are first two images. You ask for prove that publicity pictures were distributed. I know how to show publishing but I have no idea how to do prove distribution if not published. Are you suggesting we delete them as one is from the Library of Congress. Maybe they have the evidence you say is required? Otherwise this might snowball into deleting a great number of photographs on Commons. Do you know how to prove that pictures were distributed? I think it unlikely that incontrovertible evidence exists and 'common sense/reasonable person view' may be required. If you are sure then we'll delete the third image cropped? Strange question. (Can you supply a link to the rule as I've never seen that bit) But being as this image was placed on line and sold for 130,000 dollars then I would guess that it may be fairly complete. What evidence is required? There is a picture of it in a frame on a long reply I'm afraid, but you have raised some issues and it seems fair that I address them in detail. Victuallers talk 22:31, 15 October 2015 (UTC) apologies if some of my statements were unclear: The hook is fine.

More often than not, until the 1970s at least in the US, it was considered "impolite and too familiar" to refer to a woman by her given name. It makes finding sources for women really hard. You can always pare down what you know but if you start with a pared down version, it is often difficult to find the entirety and thus sources. I have little doubt that was a consideration in the naming protocols on Wikipedia, because no where does it advise that looking for Mrs. John Doe might help find sourcing.;) SusunW talk 02:14, 19 October 2015 (UTC) was just wondering whether her middle name should be given in full in the hook for the sake of consistency with the article name.

The sources equally refer to her as Beverly Greene and Beverly Loraine Greene. But the hook would go over 200 characters if we spell out her full name. There is really no requirement to spell out a name in a hook; for example, we often write Bach or Mozart to keep it short. I only put the L. in because SusunW used her middle name in the title.

Inre this matter, the article and hook needs to be updated to state that the era when this person was placed in the tomb is estimated, rather than (as worded) the construction dates, used in the article states about the "Sheesh Gumbad (Tomb)" that "These monuments (Tombs) were built between 1433 to 1533".

The problem is with the hook, which says "founded a dynasty of Irish kings". However, the (main body) of the article says that the werewolf Laignech Fàelad was a brother of kings - i.e. not an ancestor. Now, I see the "ancestor of kings" is in the cited source (Sconduto, p. 34), but that doesn't seem to be "ancestor" in the strict sense. Would you be able to explain this a bit more (i.e. to me here, but possibly also in the article)?  St   Anselm talk 02:46, 10 October 2015 main body of the article does call him an ancestor - "He was said to be the brother of Feradach mac Duach, the king of Ossory, and the ancestor of its subsequent kings who ruled until being deposed by the Normans." Sconduto, and also John Carey in 'Werewolves in Ireland', Medieval Celtic 44 (Winter 2002) 37–72, both state explicitly that Laignech Fàelad was "ancestor of [Ossory's] kings thereafter" (as Carey puts it). They don't explain how this came about so I've not expanded on it further as it would be original research on my part, but the most likely answer is that Laignech Fàelad's kingly brother died childless and the throne was inherited by one of Laignech Fàelad's children. Prioryman talk 07:27, 10 October 2015 I can understand not wanting to OR, but for DYK we really need to get to the bottom of this. I see the text here it doesn't seem to say anything about kings, and so I question the second sentence in the "Laignech Fàelad" section. The Sconduto source has a footnote for the "ancestor of its future kings" sentence, but it doesn't seem to be visible on Google Books.  St   Anselm talk 08:40, 10 October 2015 (UTC) not from the but from another work - Ingantaib specifically the manuscript held by Trinity College Dublin, according to Carey. I've made the attribution clearer in the article. Prioryman talk 09:19, 10 October 2015 (UTC) there any reason the Carey source isn't in the article, by the way? And do you have access to a translation of Ingantaib I'd like to know what it actually says, because all that I see in Sconduto is that Ingantaib talks about Laignech Fàelad being an ancestor of a line of werewolves sounds a lot like the brothers Elrond and Elros by the Anyway, I can't help feeling Sconduto is misreading Carey.  St   Anselm talk 19:10, 10 October 2015 (UTC) misreading is mine, I'm afraid - I had thought Carey was referring to Ingantaib but on a second reading it's clear that he is referring to other genealogies. The exact line I'm citing is on page 57 and reads: "This Laignech Faelad is in fact a figure of considerable dynastic importance. The genealogies portray him not only as the brother of Feradach mac Duach, a king of Ossory who died in 583 or 584, but as ancestor of its kings thereafter." I've added a reference to this in the article. The genealogies in question are discussed on which usefully has a copy of what they say along with a geneaological table (see table 1). Prioryman talk 20:36, 10 October 2015 (UTC) thank you. I think we're getting close to a resolution here. I had seen that genealogical page already, and had noted that it doesn't mention werewolves. But it seems that we have some sources saying that Laignech is a werewolf, and some sources saying that he is an ancestor of kings. However, we don't seem to have any primary source that conflates the too - it is something that Carey has noticed. This is definitely worth including in the article, and in the DYK hook, but we have to be careful of wording. Maybe something like, "He was said in some sources to be the ancestor of a tribe of werewolves, and in others to be an ancestor of the kings of Ossory." What do you think?  St   Anselm talk 21:27, 10 October 2015 (UTC) not sure that's entirely accurate. Sconduto writes that Ingantaib says that the werewolves were "descendants of Laigne[ch] Faelad in Ossory" (page 34). Unfortunately I can't find a translation or transcript of that work online. Basically, we have three facts (or rather claims) from different sources: that Laignech Faelad was the brother of the king of Ossory (according to the genealogies), that he was a werewolf (according to and that he was the ancestor of the werewolves of Ossory (according to Ingantaib So perhaps a viable alternative hook might be something like the following?

The "vampire squirrel" is also a bit tabloidesque; it's hooky but doesn't really rate inclusion in the same sentence as the observed feeding habits; I'll be back later, I'm going to rub a toad on my lips; I think that summons a prince, or is it cures warts?; gives you warts?!?? Oh great. Belle talk 17:05, 8 September 2015 added an extra reference for the tail from Science magazine, though it doesn't say anything different to the WaPo It also refers to the squirrel as a vampire; I would hope you don't consider Science to be a tabloid! The inclusion of the alleged vampirism in conjunction with the observed feeding habits is a deliberate bit of debunking. As virtually all of the recently published sources about the squirrel refer to vampirism, I thought it would be important to state up front exactly what is known about its feeding habits. I think using the vampire description in the hook is eminently justifiable as a means of making it more interesting (it seems to have made you look, so it evidently works). But be careful what you do with toads; can also get high on Prioryman talk 11:53, 10 September 2015    Actually it was the picture that hooked me, not the threat of a squirrel making me its vampire bride. Long enough, new enough, neutral (even if I think the vampire rumours get too much coverage); no copyphrasing or close vio; pic is free to use and intriguing if a bit conservative on the tail; hook fact cited; good to go.
