I also note that when somebody comes new to Wikipedia with the intention of creating a new article, they are often here to promote some subject, and usually are not aware that promotion of any kind is forbidden on Wikipedia, and that an article should be based nearly 100% on what people unconnected with the subject have published about it, and hardly at all on what the subject, their friends, relative, employees, publishers, agents or associates want to say about them.

The full comment is: While other citation templates are not forbidden, this basic template can be used, and it is placed here for convenience:. It was probably left by the original author as a helpful note. Personally, I prefer the list-defined references method since, as I mentioned above, it makes editing the text much easier. Especially on articles with a large amount of references. Also, you shouldn't change the style that is used on articles. There is no "traditional" style. The first person that adds a reference gets to pick what style they use and per WP:CITEVAR it shouldn't be changed. Stabila711 talk 01:06, 22 October 2015 (UTC) something new every day.
