A number of his early followers had instantly recognized his station as a messenger from God with divine authority, and this resulted in disagreement within the Bábi   [ 24 ]   Furthermore, even though the Báb had intended to convey his message with discretion, many of his followers (such as Táhirih openly declared the coming of the promised Hidden Imam and   [ 24 ]     and   [  edit  ]   the eighteen Letters of the Living had recognized him, the Báb and the eighteenth Letter of the Living, Quddús left on a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina the sacred cities of   [ 9 ]   At the Kaaba in Mecca, the Báb publicly declared his claim to be the Qa'im .

After their pilgrimage, the Báb and Quddús returned to Bushehr   [ 5 ]    some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. He was placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September   [ 9 ]   The Báb was released and departed for Isfahan There, many came to see him at the house of the imám jum'ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity   [ 27 ]   After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, Khan who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, Shah ordering the Báb to Tehran in January   [ 28 ]   After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, where he was   [ 9 ]          Fortress of Máh-Kú forty days in Tabriz, the Báb was then transferred to the fortress of Máh-Kú in the province of Azarbaijan close to the Turkish border. During his incarceration there, the Báb began his most important work, the which he never finished. Because of the Báb's growing popularity in Máh-Kú and the governor of Máh-Kú converting, the prime minister transferred him to the fortress of  Ch ihríq in April   [ 4 ]   In that place as well, the Báb's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. It was at this time that Áqa Bálá Big Shíshvání Naqshbandí painted the portrait of the   [ 29 ]   Hence the Prime Minister ordered the Báb back to Tabriz where the government called on religious authorities to put the Báb on trial for blasphemy and   [ 9 ]     Trial   [  edit  ]   trial, attended by the Crown Prince, occurred in July 1848 and involved numerous local clergy. They questioned the Báb about the nature of his claims, his teachings, and demanded that he produce miracles to prove his divine authority. They admonished him to recant his claims. There are nine extant eyewitness reports of the trial, of which several may originate from an earlier source. Six of the reports are from Muslim accounts, and portray the Báb in an unfavourable   [ 25 ]   There are 62 questions that are found in the nine sources, however eighteen occur in only one source, fifteen in two, eight in three, five in four, thirteen in five, and three in six.

Only one answer is found in all nine eyewitness sources, where the Báb states that "I am that person you have been awaiting for one thousand   [ 25 ]    trial did not bring a decisive result. Some clergy called for capital punishment, but the government pressured them to issue a lenient judgement because the Báb was popular. The government asked medical experts to declare the Báb insane so that he could not be executed. It is also likely that the government, to appease the religious clergy, spread rumours that the Báb had   [ 30 ]    (a very prominent local cleric), the champion of the anti-Bábí campaign, who was not at the Báb's trial, issued a conditional death sentence if the Báb was found to be sane. A fatwa was issued establishing the Báb's apostasy and stated "The repentance of an incorrigible apostate is not accepted, and the only thing which has caused the postponement of thy execution is a doubt as to thy sanity of   [ 30 ]    crown prince's physician, William Cormick, examined the Báb and complied with the government's request to find grounds for   [ 25 ]   The physician's opinion saved the Báb from execution for a time, but the clergy insisted that he face corporal punishment instead, so the Báb was bastinadoed (administered twenty lashes to the bottoms of his   [ 30 ]   The official report states that because of his harsh beating, the Báb recanted, apologized, and stated that he would not continue to advance claims of   [ 31 ]    various government sources indicate that the Báb recanted his claim, there is little non-governmental evidence of their validity.

But the language of this document is very different from the Báb's usual style; it could have been prepared by the authorities, but the Báb refused to sign   [ 25 ]      [ 30 ]   The Báb was finally ordered back to the fortress of Ch ihríq.  Execution   [  edit  ]   article: of the        The barrack square in Tabriz where the Báb was mid-1850 a new prime-minister, ,   [ 32 ]   ordered the execution of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections had been defeated and the movement's popularity appeared to be waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabríz from Ch so that he could be shot by a The night before his execution, as he was being conducted to his cell, a young Bábí, Muḥammad-`Alíy-i-Zunúzí, called Anís, threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged to be killed with him. He was immediately arrested and placed in the same cell as the the morning of July 9, 1850, the Báb was taken to the courtyard of the barracks in which he was being held, where thousands of people had gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of Christian soldiers prepared to   [ 9 ]   Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the   [ 33 ]   The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the   [ 34 ]   There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his secretary He and Anís were tied up for execution a second time, a second firing squad of Muslim soldiers was ranged in front of them, and a second order to fire was given. This time, the Báb and his companion were   [ 9 ]   In the Bábí – Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the first firing squad to kill the Báb is believed to have been a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by remains, however, were clandestinely rescued by a handful of Bábis and were hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported according to instructions of Bahá'u'lláh and then `Abdu'l-Bahá by way of Isfahan, Kirmanshah, Baghdad and Damascus to Beirut and thence by sea to Acre on the plain below in   [ 35 ]   On March 21, 1909, the remains were then interred in a special tomb erected for this purpose by `Abdu'l-Bahá on Mount Carmel in present-day Haifa   [ 36 ]   The World is located close to this site and visitors are welcome to tour the  Succession   [  edit  ]   article:        of the  most of his prominent writings, The Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as Whom God shall make and that he himself was "but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest." Within 20 years of the Báb's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly Bahá'u'lláh . the Báb's death, he sent a letter to Mírzá Yahyá, titled Subh-i-Azal which some consider to be a will and   [ 37 ]   The letter is recognized as appointing Subh-i-Azal to be the leader of the Bábí community after the death of the Báb. He is also ordered to obey the Promised One when he   [ 38 ]   At the time Subh-i-Azal was still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the Bábí movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bahá'u'lláh. All of this lends credence to the Bahá'í claim that the Báb appointed Subh-i-Azal the head of the Bábí Faith so as to divert attention away from Bahá'u'lláh, while allowing Bábís to visit Bahá'u'lláh and consult with him freely, and allowing Bahá'u'lláh to write to Bábís easily and freely. Furthermore, there is a long history in Shí`ism of hidden leaders, with their deputies wielding the true power (the four bábs themselves are the first examples of this, as is `Alí-Muhammad's choice of the title "the claimed that in 1852, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a of which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He Whom God shall make manifest". His followers began calling themselves Bahá'ís .   [ 39 ]    continued to live with or close to Bahá'u'lláh throughout the latter's exiles from Iran to Baghdad and then to Istanbul and Edirne, even though Bahá'u'lláh's claim to be a Manifestation of God in 1863 theoretically rendered moot Subh-i-Azal's authority as the head of the Bábí community. In September 1867, in Edirne, the rival claims to authority came to a head. Subh-i-Azal challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in Edirne (Adrianople), such that "God would strike down the impostor". Bahá'u'lláh agreed and went to the Sultan Selim Mosque at the appointed time, but Subh-i-Azal failed to show   [ 40 ]    followers became known as Azalis or Azali Bábís. For the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh, Subh-i-Azal remained their leader until his death in 1912. Whether or not he had a successor is disputed. Bahá'í sources report that 11 of the 18 "witnesses" appointed by Subh-i-Azal to oversee the Bábí community became Bahá'ís, as well as his son. The man allegedly appointed by Subh-i-Azal to succeed him, Hadíy-i-Dawlat-Abádí, later publicly recanted his faith in the Báb and   [ 41 ]    Bahá'u'llah emerged more successful and nearly all of the Báb's followers abandoned Subh-i-Azal and became Bahá'ís. Today Bahá'ís have several million followers, while estimates of the number of Azalís are generally around one thousand, isolated in   [ 42 ]     Teachings   [  edit  ]   article: of the  Báb's teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the Qur'an and other While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to philosophical elucidation and finally to legislative pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the metaphysics of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly   [ 43 ]   An analysis of the Báb's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and   [ 44 ]     Writings   [  edit  ]     has quotations related to:   Báb    of the writings of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of   [ 45 ]   Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at Máh-Kú, which have been lost without a   [ 46 ]   Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted   [ 47 ]    works were revealed in response to specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as the Three quarters of the chapters of the are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within   [ 48 ]   Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and Archives Department at the World currently holds about 190 Tablets of the   [ 49 ]   Excerpts from several principal works have been published in the only English-language compilation of the Báb's writings:  from the Writings of the  Denis MacEoin, in his for Early Bābī Doctrine and gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the Báb revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur'an, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in   [ 50 ]    Báb has been criticized for his inconsistent use of correct and incorrect in his religious works, though in his Arabic letters made very few   [ 51 ]   A reason for this inconsistency could be to distinguish those who could not see past the outer form of the words from those that could understand the deeper meaning of his   [ 51 ]      [ 52 ]     before his   [  edit  ]       Lawson noted this in his doctoral dissertation about the Tafsír-i-súrih-i-baqarih or "Commentary on the Surih of the Cow", a work the Báb wrote on a chapter of the   [ 53 ]   This Qur'an commentary was started by the Báb in November or December 1843, some six months before declaring his mission.

It witnessed the composition of some of the Báb's most important    This is undoubtedly the most important work of the Báb and contains a mature summary of his teachings. It was composed in Máh-Kú in late 1847 or early 1848. The work consists of nine chapters titled váhids or "unities", which in turn are usually subdivided into nineteen bábs or "gates"; the one exception is the last unity, which has only ten bábs. The Báb explained that it would be the task of "He Whom God shall make manifest" to complete the work; Bahá'ís believe Bahá'u'lláh's  Kitáb-i-Iqán  to be the completion of the Bayán. Each unity begins with an Arabic summary of its contents, which makes it easier to read than many of the Báb's works. Extracts of this work are published in from the Writings of the A. L. M. Nicholas translated the entire work into French in four 150-page   [ 67 ]       This is the shorter and less important of the two Bayáns. It consists of eleven váhids or "unities", each with nineteen bábs or "gates". It offers a succinct summary of the Báb's teachings and laws.

It was penned during the Báb's last days at Chihríq, before his execution. The various manuscript copies contain numerous variations in the text; the book will require considerable work to reconstruct its original   [ 71 ]     ("Book of Five Grades"): Having been composed in March and April 1850, this is one of the Báb's last works. The book consists of eighty-five sections arranged in seventeen groups, each under the heading of a different name of God. Within each group are five "grades", that is, five different sorts of sections: verses, prayers, homilies, commentaries, and Persian language pieces. Each group was sent to a different person and was composed on a different day. Thus the work is a kind of miscellany of unrelated material. Some of the sections represent further exposition of basic themes in the Báb's teachings; others consists of lengthy iterations of the names of God, and variations on their   [ 72 ]     in the Bahá'í   [  edit  ]   the the events of the birth, declaration and death of the Báb are commemorated by Bahá'í communities on a yearly   [ 73 ]       [  edit  ]          claiming to be the   of founders of religious   punishment in   Notes   [  edit  ]      ^    Habibu'llah Afnan (2008).
