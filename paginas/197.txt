Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles (or other pages) that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the the category itself.

[ 1 ]   A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories .  pages in  page belongs to a category if the page's wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form [[Category: ]] or [[Category: | Sortkey ]] The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between nowiki.../nowiki or includeonly.../includeonly tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see and category name can be any string that would be a legitimate It cannot begin with a lower-case letter. If the category name given in a category declaration begins with a lower-case letter, then it is interpreted as if it were Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any stub templates (which themselves transclude categories) and . a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page (or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used). This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as redlinks if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole categories are not displayed, except as described below under .   category page is a page in the "Category:" namespace. The page Name corresponds to the category called Name New category pages can be created like any other pages – by clicking on a red link or entering the name in the search box and clicking at "You may create the category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as a count and list of subcategories (other category pages belonging to the category) is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by a count of its own subcategories. These further subcategories are expanded in the display if the ► sign alongside the subcategory is clicked (but this widget is only visible if your browser has JavaScript enabled). Note: ► is shown if there are no further subcategories. The subcategory is collapsed again if ▼ is a count and list of pages in the category (excluding subcategories and images) is shown. If the category has no members, a message to that effect is a count and list of image and other media files in the category appears, if any exist. These are shown with thumbnails. The first 20 characters of the file name are shown, with an ellipsis if that is not the full name; also the file size is items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it (the name of the the way in which the lists are ordered, see below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections.

If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next   The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e. its (the categories of which it is a subcategory). Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the or | Sortkey  to category  link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink.

Thus "1 dog", "11 dogs", and "112 dogs" all appear under the "1" heading (not under "1", "10", and "100" headings). This will cause "112 dogs" to appear before "2 dogs" on the category of the three lists (subcategories, pages, media files) is arranged in the order explained above (except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator "Category:" is not considered). If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name (sort key) for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the [[Category: | Sortkey ]] example to add an article called to the category "People" and have the article sorted by "Einstein, Albert", you would with a (which uses the same syntax), the sort key itself is not displayed to readers.

This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also "hidden" (included by another   the __HIDDENCAT__ is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category.

This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page. When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved. When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list.

To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between noinclude.../noinclude tags, or add it to the page between includeonly/includeonly (the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch  can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably a category by or If the user provides a parameter 'cat=XXX' the page will be categorized at the page [[Category:XXX]] otherwise it will be categorized at the page [[Category:default]] Calling the template with "cat=" (equal to nothing) disables putting the page in any non-article | | the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles.

On a category page, redirects are listed in conventions on the categorization of redirects in Wikipedia, see .  and redirecting category   can be in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal #REDIRECT[[...]] but a {{ }} Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect, or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates (see above), modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned.

To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:" CategoryName " in the search "OR" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example,  bridges" OR incategory:"Bridges in New York  return all pages that belong to either (or both) of the categories, as here . that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates.

Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their are that "Related Changes" does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page (as it would normally, with a non-category page). (If a workaround is required for this, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category usual (unlike with watchlists recent changes to corresponding are not shown under "Related Changes". Pages you are watching are bolded on the list (this can be helpful for finding which pages in a given category you have on your Changes" can be used to find pages which have recently been added to a category (unless they were added through modification of a template; then links should be used with the template). However it is not possible to detect deletions from a category in this way (since once pages have been removed from a category, their edits no longer show up in Related Changes). Another way of finding recent additions is to use an API query; see category below. There is external to watch additions and removals from categories.

To list all existing category pages (regardless of whether they have members), use Special:AllPages/Category: .  category trees and page  described at {{PAGESINCATEGORY: Example }} or {{PAGESINCAT: Example }} returns the number of pages in "Category:Example".
