I edited Wikipedia for about five/six years up until I took a break circa 2010. My previous account, User:Karrmann I used throughout that time when I was a teenager in middle school and high school. Now that I have returned to Wikipedia after my absence as an adult I created this new account because I don't want to be associated with that old account. That old account was in good standing. I was never blocked or banned, or ever had any conflicts or issues with admins. I just don't want to be associated with the edits and stuff I made ten years ago when I was 14, kind of like when people take five year old drunk pictures off of their Facebook accounts.

I'm not sure if the place is even notable, but my concern is if something scandalous happens to a celebrity at a particular place - such as hotel or a place like this - is it appropriate to include information about it in the place's article just because the incident happened there? What if this had happened at a big-name hotel or restaurant or other place?

I am assuming the 2F stands for 2 files so it must be something in the File namespace that is triggering it. I just don't know why it is not displaying those files in the category listings.
