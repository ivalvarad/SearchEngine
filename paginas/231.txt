Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations in Han population history, as the population fled south to the Yangtze and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center south and speeding up Sinicization of the far south. At the same time, in the north, most of the nomads in northern China came to be Sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of Chinese culture and Chinese administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of the Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic Sinicization, Han institutions, and Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete Sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong The later part of the Tang dynasty, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for articles: and        Han Chinese man wears a queue in compliance with Manchu custom during the Qing next few centuries saw successive invasions of non-Han peoples from the north, such as the Khitans and Jurchens In 1279, the Mongols conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes.

However, it is noteworthy that the expansion process was dominated by males, as is shown by a greater contribution to the Y-chromosome than the mtDNA from northern Hans to southern Hans. These genetic observations are in line with historical records of continuous and large migratory waves of northern China inhabitants escaping warfare and famine, to southern China. Aside from these large migratory waves, other smaller southward migrations also occurred during almost all periods in the past two   [ 63 ]   Moreover, a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences into the gene frequency data of Han subpopulations and ethnic minorities in China, showed that Han subpopulations in different regions are also genetically close to the local ethnic minorities, and it means that in many cases blood of ethnic minorities has mixed into Han, while at the same time, blood of Han also has mixed into the local   [ 73 ]   A recent, and to date the most extensive, genome-wide association study of the Han population shows that geographic-genetic stratification from north to south has occurred and centrally placed populations act as the conduit for outlying   [ 74 ]   Ultimately, with the exception in some ethnolinguistic branches of the Han Chinese, such as Pinghua there is coherent genetic structure in all Han Chinese   [ 75 ]     References   [  edit  ]       a       b       c       d      "Han Chinese 91.6%" out of a reported population of 1,355 billion (July 2014     ^   A.
