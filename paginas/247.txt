English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers.

It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the  circles of English-speaking   distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a circles .   [ 60 ]   In his model, the "inner circle" countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English, "outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and "expanding circle" countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language.

The three circles change membership over   [ 61 ]    with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English.

They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those   [ 70 ]   Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle   [ 70 ]   and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle   [ 70 ]    the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the "expanding   [ 77 ]   The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over   [ 76 ]   For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use   [ 78 ]   and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, the widespread use of English in these countries puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle".

In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than nib [nɪˑp̬] ).

Phonotactics  English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /sprɪnt/ and end with up to four, as in texts /teksts/ This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly s and a voiceless stop, as in stay and s a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string .   [ 136 ]   Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable final   [ 137 ]     rhythm and  also: and vowel reduction in and in   Stress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are   [ 138 ]   Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as can have and strong depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a in English is phonemic and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable   /  ˈ  k  ɒ  n  t  r  æ  k  t  /        KON   -trakt   when used as a noun, but on the last syllable   /  k  ə  n  ˈ  t  r  æ  k  t  /     kən-   TRAKT      for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a   [ 139 ]      [ 140 ]      [ 141 ]   Here stress is connected to in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/ but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/ Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. búrn versus and versus hót .   [ 142 ]    terms of rhythm English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened.

A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one many some and all are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. (sg.) but (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun   [ 155 ]     Adjectives  modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after   [ 156 ]   In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases slender and slender the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the adjectives are inflected for of with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: small boy is smaller than the boy is the Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good better and best Other adjectives have comparatives formed by with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or or .

[ 164 ]   The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American Vernacular English or youse and ye found in Irish personal Person Reflexive p.

A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation - for example the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentences already told you or told Mike I don't want to see him here The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for   [ 165 ]     Prepositions  phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. the my Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describing movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example, in the phrase gave it to the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as  Pullum no longer consider government and case to be defining for the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional  and verb  verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and marked for agreement with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person   [ 157 ]   Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question   [ 166 ]      [ 167 ]    verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third person singular present, and a preterit (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past   [ 168 ]   The copula verb s the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being . inflectional Inflection Strong Regular  take   love  person  takes   loves  Preterit  took   loved   take   love  Gerund–participle  taking   loving   taken   loved   aspect and  has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s .   [ 166 ]     Present Preterite         does not have a grammaticalised future   [ 169 ]   Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall .   [ 170 ]   Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb going .   [ 171 ]     Future  will   will  aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense have vs. was and compound tenses such as preterite perfect had been and present perfect have been ).

[ 170 ]    infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, has to where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as saw him where the main verb is which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the   also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are get ask back give get hang put up etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. meaning someone's ).   [ 173 ]   In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including  Pullum do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. woke up in the and ran up in the are syntactically  Adverbs  function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase woman walked the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well .

The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the    bites    S V O    bites    S V O exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form. The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine  He   hit   him  S V O  (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as gave Jane the or in a prepositional phrase, such as gave the book    [ 177 ]      article: clause  English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase think (that) you are the main clause is headed by the verb think the subject is I but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause you are The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often   [ 178 ]   are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence saw the letter that you received the relative clause you received specifies the meaning of the word letter the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who whose whom and which as well as by that (which can also be   [ 179 ]   In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate   [ 180 ]     verb  articles: Do-support and  syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence dog did not find its the clause its is the complement of the negated verb is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I did shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in know can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like do not (don't) The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say you grammatical rules require you know    [ 181 ]    is done with the adverb not which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English don't know is the correct answer to the question you know but not know him although this construction may be found in older   [ 182 ]    constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb or although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get For example, putting the sentence sees into the passive becomes is seen (by or gets seen (by .   [ 183 ]     Questions  English questions can be formed either with do-support you know or with the interrogative pronouns (e.g. who, where, when, In most constructions interrogative pronouns occur in a before the subject-verb compound, regardless of their grammatical role in the sentence. For example, in the sentence did you what refers to the grammatical object of the sentence but nonetheless occurs as the sentence's first constituent. Also prepositional phrases can be fronted when they are the theme of the question, e.g. did you go last The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only one of the interrogative pronouns to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form is no longer in use by many speakers. For those speaker who do use it, it distinguishes between questions where the theme of the question is the grammatical subject of the verb, from those where it is the object or another grammatical role that is being questioned. E.g. saw but did you   level  the discourse level English tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, girl was stung by the Another way is through a where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a such as it or there e.g. was the girl that the bee was a girl who was stung by a .   [ 184 ]   Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., is or in existential clauses are many cars on the Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO  emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, girl was stung by  (emphasising it was a bee and not for example a wasp that stung her), or  was stung by a (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the   [ 185 ]   Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, girl over there, she was stung by a emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, was stung by a bee, that girl over where reference to the girl is established as an   [ 186 ]     Cohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. is exactly what I where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated   [ 187 ]   such as oh so or well also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, way is that (the idiomatic marker expressing disbelief), or I'm (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal   [ 188 ]     Vocabulary  vocabulary of English is vast, and counting exactly how many words English (or any language) has is   [ 189 ]      [ 190 ]      [ 191 ]   Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality ,   [ 192 ]   collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes   [ 191 ]      [ 193 ]     formation  forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is   [ 194 ]   using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal   [ 191 ]      [ 193 ]   producing compound words such as babysitter or or homesick .   [ 194 ]   A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes -hood -ness -ing -ility to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin). Formation of new words, called neologisms based on Greek or Latin roots (for example television or optometry is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the scientific (ISV) when compiling Third New International (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms ,   [ 195 ]   words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. NATO laser ).   article: of English loanwords by country or language of  besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000   [ 196 ]   The most commonly used words in English are West   [ 197 ]   The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old   [ 191 ]   But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from Latin or from other Romance   [ 198 ]   French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of   [ 199 ]    has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its   [ 193 ]      [ 191 ]   Many of the words borrowed into English from Latin were earlier borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and   [ 200 ]   English continues to gain new loanwords and calques ("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60 percent of the vocabulary of   [ 201 ]   English has formal and informal and informal registers, including child directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic   [ 202 ]      [ 203 ]     loanwords and calques in other  has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other   [ 199 ]      [ 204 ]   The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other   [ 205 ]   That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other   [ 206 ]   Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating   [ 207 ]   Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in   [ 207 ]      also: and  the ninth century, English has been written in a (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman   [ 28 ]   The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, spelling system, or orthography of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic   [ 208 ]   Further complications have arisen through with which the orthography has not kept   [ 40 ]   Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is   [ 209 ]   There are also systematic differences between British and American These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in   [ 210 ]    letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English   [ 211 ]   Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words photograph photography and photographic ,   [ 211 ]   or the words electricity and electrical While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is   [ 208 ]   there is a rationale for current English spelling   [ 212 ]   The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the   [ 213 ]   Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each   [ 214 ]    of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, represent, respectively, the phonemes d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, The letters c and g normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/ but there is also a c  pronounced /s/ and a g  pronounced /dʒ/ The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /tʃ/ sh for /ʃ/ th for /θ/ or /ð/ ng for /ŋ/ qu for /kw/ and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of   [ 211 ]   or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic   [ 215 ]    the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are vowel letters a e i o u w y As a result of a smaller set of single letter symbols than the set of vowel phonemes, some are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat the ow in how and the ay in stay or the historically based e  (as in note and cake ).   [ 212 ]    consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or   [ 216 ]   Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used   [ 211 ]   Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in   [ 217 ]      [ 218 ]   Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write   [ 219 ]    writing also includes a system of punctuation that is similar to the system of punctuation marks used in most alphabetic languages around the world.

Within the United Kingdom, the (RP), an educated dialect of East traditionally used as the broadcast standard, and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the of English grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to   [ 222 ]   Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP   [ 223 ]   There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in   [ 224 ]   Within Britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is aitch-dropping which historically was a feature of lower class London English, particularly Cockney, but which today is the standard in all major English cities—yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British   [ 225 ]             your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported You can the or a to play the clip in your  example of an Essex male with a working-class Estuary accent (entertainer )    playing this file?

In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. Today a large area of Southeastern England has adopted traits from Cockney, resulting in the so-called which spread in areas south and East of London beginning in the 1980s.

In in the area surrounding Dublin two highly conservative dialects known as and and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Hiberno-English however has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, a dialect with strong influence from Scots, and southern Hiberno-English. Like Scots and Northern English, the Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in most dialects influenced by   [ 15 ]      [ 230 ]      articles: American Vernacular American and        The merger of pin and pen in Southern American English.

Based on Ash  Boberg :68). before the independence of the USA, American English was highly homogeneous. Early American authors commented on the lack of significant linguistic variation across the colonised area of the Eastern seaboard. Today there is more variation, yet two thirds of Americans speak a broad dialect known as (GA), although as with RP in Britain there are different accents also within it. Separate from GA is American (SAE), widely spoken in the Southern states, and American Vernacular (AAVE) spoken by African Americans in most major cities.

Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties.

Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [e:] and [o:] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. bay and boat pronounced [bʲe:] and [bʷo:t] Often word final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and "wind" [win] .
