Major geographical features in its watershed include the Buttermilk Falls in its lower reaches, as well as and . number of bridges have been constructed over Buttermilk Creek. There is also some development in the watershed. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed were agriculture and a summer resort.

It flows south for a few tenths of a mile before turning west for a few miles. In this reach, the creek enters a valley, passes through two ponds or small lakes, and passes by Griffin Hill. It then enters Falls Township, Wyoming County, where it eventually turns northwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Route The creek then gradually turns west and then southwest for more than a mile, remaining in its valley and flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 307. It then receives Beaver Creek, its first named tributary, from the right and turns south. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns west and receives the tributary Falls Creek from the left The creek then turns south-southwest for more than a mile and its valley broadens. It then turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile. At this point, the creek turns west. After a few tenths of a mile, it passes Buttermilk Falls and reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna   [ 1 ]    Creek joins the Susquehanna River 208.58 miles (335.68km) upriver of its   [ 2 ]     Tributaries   [  edit  ]   Creek has two named tributaries: Falls Creek and Beaver   [ 1 ]   Falls Creek joins Buttermilk Creek 2.00 miles (3.22km) upstream of its mouth and its watershed has an area of 7.27 square miles 2 Beaver Creek joins Buttermilk Creek 2.58 miles (4.15km) upstream of its mouth and drains an area of 9.81 square miles 2 ).
