Currently around 40 countries use the weapon, and it is manufactured in several variants by nine countries. It is popular with irregular and The RPG has been used in almost all conflicts across all continents since the mid-1960s from the to the early 2010s in . the most commonly seen major variations are the RPG-7D paratrooper model (able to be broken into two parts for easier carrying), and the lighter Chinese 69 DIO of Iran manufactures RPG-7s with olive green handguards, HK pistol grips, and a Commando RPG-7 was first delivered to the Soviet Army in 1961 and deployed at a squad level. It replaced the RPG-2, having clearly out-performed the intermediate RPG-4 design during testing. The current model produced by the is the RPG-7V2 capable of firing standard and dual explosive (HEAT) rounds / fragmentation and thermobaric warheads (see below), with a UP-7V sighting device fitted (used in tandem with the standard 2.7× PGO-7 to allow the use of extended range ammunition. The RPG-7D3 is the equivalent paratrooper model.

The middle of the tube is wood wrapped to protect the user from heat and the end is flared to assist in blast shielding and recoil [   dubious  discuss   ] Sighting is usually optical with a back-up and passive infra-red and are also available.

The grenade is stabilized by two sets of fins that deploy in-flight: one large set on the stabilizer pipe to maintain direction and a smaller front set to induce rotation. The grenade can fly up to 1,100meters; the fuze sets the maximum range, usually   [ 9 ]       [  edit  ]         An National soldier firing an RPG-7, to the States Army Training and Doctrine (TRADOC) Bulletin 3u (1977) RPG-7 Antitank Grenade Launcher—Capabilities and the RPG-7 munition has two sections: a "booster" section and a "warhead and sustainer motor" section. These must be assembled into the ready-to-use grenade. The booster consists of a "small strip powder charge" that serves to propel the grenade out of the launcher; the sustainer motor then ignites and propels the grenade for the next few seconds, giving it a top speed of 294meters per second. The TRADOC bulletin provides anecdotal commentary that the RPG-7 has been fired from within buildings, which agrees with the two-stage design. It is stated that only a 2-meter standoff to a rear obstruction is needed for use inside rooms or fortifications. The fins not only provide drag stabilization, but are designed to impart a slow rotation to the to the configuration of the RPG-7 sustainer/warhead section, it responds counter-intuitively to crosswinds. A crosswind will tend to exert pressure on the stabilizing fins, causing the projectile to turn into the wind. While the rocket motor is still burning, this will cause the flight path to curve into the wind. The TRADOC bulletin explains aiming difficulties for more distant moving targets in crosswinds at some length. Similar to a the RPG-7 has no noticeable recoil, the only effect during firing being that of the sudden lightness of the launcher as the rocket leaves the  Ammunition   [  edit  ]                Inside of an RPG's three sections.
