It breeds in Europe Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Canada Mexico Peru Brazil Argentina Uruguay the Chile Australia and .   [ 3 ]   It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on latitude the common blackbird may be resident partially migratory or fully male of the which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous eating a wide range of insects earthworms berries and fruits . sexes are territorial on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs stay in their territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate This common and conspicuous species has given rise to a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its  Contents   1 and    1.1 Subspecies     1.2     2 Description     3 and     4 and    4.1 Breeding     4.2 and     4.3 Feeding     4.4     5 and     6     7 References     8     9    9.1     9.2 and     9.3 Images     and   [  edit  ]   common blackbird was described by Linnaeus in the edition of his  in 1758 as (characterised as ater, rostro palpebrisque ).   [ 4 ]   The binomial name derives from two Latin words, turdus "thrush", and merula "blackbird", the latter giving rise to its French name, merle ,   [ 5 ]   and its Scots name, merl .   [ 6 ]   About 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus Turdus characterised by rounded heads, longish, pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. The common blackbird seems to be closest in evolutionary terms to the T.poliocephalus of and islands in the southwest Pacific which probably diverged from stock fairly   [ 7 ]    may not immediately be clear why the name "blackbird", first recorded in 1486, was applied to this species, but not to one of the various other common black English birds, such as the raven rook or jackdaw However, in and in up to about the 18th century, "bird" was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones such as crows were called "fowl". At that time, the blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous "black bird" in the British   [ 8 ]   Until about the 17th century, another name for the species was ouzel ousel or wosel (from osle cf. German Amsel Another variant occurs in Act 3 of Shakespeare's  Midsummer Night's  where Bottom refers to "The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill". The ouzel usage survived later in poetry and still occurs as the name of the closely related and in water ouzel, an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar ).

[ 11 ]   The term is often limited to smaller species with mostly or entirely black plumage, at least in the breeding male, notably the cowbirds ,   [ 12 ]   the grackles ,   [ 13 ]   and for around 20 species with "blackbird" in the name, such as the and the .

This consists of a short run, the head first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously. If a fight between male blackbirds does occur, it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away. The female blackbird is also aggressive in the spring when it competes with other females for a good nesting territory, and although fights are less frequent, they tend to be more   [ 21 ]    bill's appearance is important in the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier   [ 25 ]    long as winter food is available, both the male and female will remain in the territory throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger   [ 14 ]     Breeding   [  edit  ]         Eggs, Collection  male common blackbird attracts the female with a courtship display which consists of oblique runs combined with head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a "strangled" low song.

[ 28 ]   Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone.

The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July. It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive seee a pook-pook-pook alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various chink and vocalisations.
