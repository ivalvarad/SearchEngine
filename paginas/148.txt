Indeed, World War II ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called the as p.67, indicates: "Truman presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent.

In 1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world's gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain. It was also nearing completion of the atomic bomb, a technological and production feat of huge costs and     ^     United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941– October U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of the Historian.
