Enemy industry, their seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, effectively taking away their means to resist. It was also thought the bombing of residential centres would cause a collapse of civilian will, which might have led to the collapse of production and civil life. Democracies, where the populace was allowed to show overt disapproval of the ruling government, were thought particularly vulnerable. This thinking was prevalent in both the RAF and what was then known as the States Army Air (USAAC) between the two Bomber policy in particular would attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and   [ 16 ]    the Luftwaffe, there was a more muted view of strategic bombing. The OKL did not oppose the strategic bombardment of enemy industries and or cities, and believed it could greatly affect the balance of power on the battlefield in Germany's favour by disrupting production and damaging civilian morale, but they did not believe that air power alone could be decisive. Contrary to popular belief, the Luftwaffe did not have a systematic policy of what became known as "terror bombing". Evidence suggests that the Luftwaffe did not adopt an official bombing policy in which civilians became the primary target until   [ 17 ]    vital industries and transport centres that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. It could be claimed civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as "terror bombing", the concept of attacking vital war industries—and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale—was ruled as   [ 18 ]          Walter the era, until 1939, debate and discussion raged within German military journals over the role of strategic bombardment. Some argued along the lines of the British and   [ 19 ]   first Chief of the General Staff—championed strategic bombing and the building of appropriate aircraft for that purpose, although he emphasised the importance of aviation in operational and tactical terms. Wever outlined five key points to air destroy the enemy air force by bombing its bases and aircraft factories, and defeating enemy air forces attacking German prevent the movement of large enemy ground forces to the decisive areas by destroying railways and roads, particularly bridges and tunnels, which are indispensable for the movement and supply of support the operations of the army formations, independent of railways, i.e., armoured forces and motorised forces, by impeding the enemy advance and participating directly in ground support naval operations by attacking naval bases, protecting Germany's naval bases and participating directly in naval paralyse the enemy armed forces by stopping production in the armaments   [ 20 ]    argued that the Luftwaffe General Staff should not be solely educated in tactical and operational matters. He argued they should be educated in grand strategy, war economics, armament production, and the mentality of potential opponents (also known as Wever's vision was not realised; the General Staff studies in those subjects fell by the wayside, and the Air Academies focused on tactics, technology, and operational planning, rather than on independent strategic air   [ 21 ]    1936, Wever was killed in an air crash. The failure to implement his vision for the new Luftwaffe was largely attributable to his immediate successors.

The Luftwaffe was not pressured into ground support operations because of pressure from the army, or because it was led by ex-army personnel. It was instead a mission that suited the Luftwaffe‍ '​s pre-existing approach to warfare; a culture of joint inter-service operations, rather than independent strategic air   [ 22 ]     Göring and air   [  edit  ]         Hitler and Göring, March  Hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes. He told the OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right. But he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz. He frequently complained of the Luftwaffe‍ '​s inability to damage industries sufficiently, saying, "The munitions industry cannot be interfered with effectively by air raids... usually the prescribed targets are not   [ 23 ]      [ 24 ]    the war was being planned Hitler never insisted upon the Luftwaffe planning a strategic bombing campaign, and did not even give ample warning to the air staff that war with Britain or even Russia was an imminent possibility. The amount of firm operational and tactical preparation for a bombing campaign was minimal, largely because of the failure by Hitler as supreme commander to insist upon such a   [ 23 ]    Hitler was trapped within his own vision of bombing as a terror weapon, formed in the 1930s when he threatened smaller nations into accepting German rule rather than submit to air bombardment. This fact had important implications. It showed the extent to which Hitler personally mistook Allied strategy for one of morale breaking instead of one of with the collapse of morale as an additional   [ 25 ]   Hitler was much more attracted to the political aspects of bombing. Where the mere threat of it had produced diplomatic results in the 1930s, he expected that mere threat of German retaliation to persuade the Allies to adopt a policy of moderation and not to begin a policy of unrestricted bombing. His hope was — for reasons of political prestige within Germany itself — that the German population would be protected from the Allied bombings. When this proved impossible, he began to fear that popular feeling would turn against his regime, and he redoubled efforts to mount a similar "terror offensive" against Britain in order to produce a stalemate in which both sides would hesitate to use bombing at   [ 25 ]    major problem in the managing of the Luftwaffe was Hitler believed the Luftwaffe was "the most effective strategic weapon", and in reply to repeated requests from the  Kriegsmarine  for control over aircraft insisted, "We should never have been able to hold our own in this war if we had not had an undivided   [ 26 ]   Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in Göring a jealous and damaging defence of his "empire" while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the Luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and Göring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost   [ 26 ]   In 1940 and 1941, Göring's refusal to cooperate with the Kriegsmarine denied the entire Wehrmacht military forces of the Reich the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British   [ 27 ]    deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major "communications gap" between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, Göring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When Göring decided against continuing Wever's heavy programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, Göring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe‍ '​s most advanced equipment at Rechlin to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the   [ 28 ]     of   [  edit  ]   articles: of Adlertag Hardest and of Britain        RAF pilots with one of their October hours of the UK and France declaring war on Germany on 3 September 1939, the RAF bombed German warships along the German coast at Wilhelmshaven Thereafter bombing operations were against ports and shipping and propaganda leaflet drops. Operations were planned to minimize civilian casualties. From 15 May 1940 – the day after Luftwaffe destroyed the centre of – the RAF also carried out operations east of the Rhine, attacking industrial and transportation targets. Operations were carried out every night not specifically prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the Luftwaffe was expected to do so over Britain. From July until September 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked Fighter to gain as a prelude to invasion. This involved the bombing of convoys, ports, and RAF airfields and supporting industries. Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow the Germans to gain control of the skies over the invasion area. It was supposed that Bomber Coastal and the could not operate effectively under conditions of German air   [ 29 ]    Luftwaffe's poor intelligence meant that their aircraft were not always able to locate their targets, and thus attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results. British fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing Germany's by 2 to   [ 30 ]   The British produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940, in comparison to Germany's   [ 31 ]   The replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult. Both the RAF and Luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses, though the Germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew. The circumstances affected the Germans more than the British. Operating over home territory, British flyers could fly again if they survived being shot down. German crews, even if they survived, faced capture. Moreover, bombers had four to five crewmen on board, representing a greater loss of   [ 32 ]   On 7 September, the Germans shifted away from the destruction of the RAF's supporting structures.

With no sign of the RAF weakening, and Luftwaffe air fleets  Luftflotten  taking punishing losses, the OKL was keen for a change in strategy. To reduce losses further, a change in strategy was also favoured to take place at night, to give the bombers greater protection under cover of   [ 39 ]      [ b ]   On 4 September 1940, in a long address at the Sportspalast, Hitler declared: "And should the Royal Air Force drop two thousand, or three thousand [kilograms ...] then we will now drop [...] 300,000, 400,000, yes one million kilograms in a single night. And should they declare they will greatly increase their attacks on our cities, then we will erase their was decided to focus on bombing Britain's industrial cities in daylight to begin with. The main focus of the bombing operations was against the city of London. The first major raid in this regard took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as the of Britain a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although there were a few large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks in order to reduce losses. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got underway against London and other British cities. However, the Luftwaffe faced limitations. Its Do Ju and He capable of carrying out strategic   [ 41 ]   but were incapable of doing greater damage because of bomb-load   [ 42 ]   The Luftwaffe‍ '​s decision in the interwar period to concentrate on can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or foresee a war with Britain in 1939; the OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the   [ 43 ]    it had equipment capable of doing serious damage, the problem for the Luftwaffe was its unclear strategy and poor intelligence. OKL had not been informed that Britain was to be considered a potential opponent until early 1938. It had no time to gather reliable intelligence on Britain's industries. Moreover, OKL could not settle on an appropriate strategy. German planners had to decide whether the Luftwaffe should deliver the weight of its attacks against a specific segment of British industry such as aircraft factories, or against a system of interrelated industries such as Britain's import and distribution network, or even in a blow aimed at breaking the morale of the British   [ 44 ]   The Luftwaffe‍ '​s strategy became increasingly aimless over the winter of   [ 45 ]   Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than   [ 46 ]   This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it   [ 47 ]    an operational capacity, limitations in weapons technology and quick British reactions were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect. Attacking ports, shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas, especially the distribution of coal, an important fuel in all industrial economies of the Second World War, would net a positive result. However, the use of while initially very effective, gradually had less impact, partly because they failed to   [ c ]   Moreover, the British had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the on Imperial estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Civil such as the of supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of   [ 51 ]   In 1939 military theorist predicted that 250,000 deaths and injuries in Britain could occur in the first week of   [ 50 ]          flying over central were aware of the deadly power of aerial attacks through newsreels of Barcelona, Guernica and Shanghai Many popular works of fiction during the 1920s and 1930s portrayed aerial bombing, such as G. novel  Shape of Things to  and its film and others such as Air War of and Poison wrote in 1956 that he and others around him "thought of air warfare in 1938 rather as people think of nuclear war   [ 52 ]    :39–41  addition to the dead and wounded, government leaders feared mass psychological trauma from aerial attack and a resulting collapse of civil society. A committee of psychiatrists reported to the government in 1938 that there would be three times as many mental as physical casualties from aerial bombing, implying three to four million psychiatric   [ 53 ]   told Parliament in 1934, "We must expect that, under the pressure of continuous attack upon London, at least three or four million people would be driven out into the open country around the   [ 50 ]   Panicked reactions during the such as the migration by 150,000 to Wales, contributed to fear of societal   [ 54 ]    government planned to evacuate four million women and children—from urban areas, including 1.4 million from London. It expected about 90% of evacuees to stay in private homes, and conducted an extensive survey to determine available space. Detailed preparations for transporting them were developed. A trial blackout was held on 10 August 1939, and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September a blackout began at sunset. Lights would not be allowed after dark for almost six   [ 55 ]   and the blackout became by far the most unpopular aspect of the war for civilians, more than rationing .

In addition, authorities expected that the raids would be brief and during the day. Few predicted that attacks by night would force Londoners to sleep in   [ 56 ]       [  edit  ]         tube being used as a bomb shelter in deeply buried shelters provided the most protection against a direct hit. The government did not build them for large populations before the war because of cost, time to build, and fears that their very safety would cause occupants to refuse to leave to return to work, or that anti-war sentiment would develop in large groups. The government saw the leading role in advocating for building deep shelters as an attempt to damage civilian morale, especially after the of August   [ 52 ]    :34    [ 56 ]    most important existing communal shelters were the stations. Although many civilians had used them as such during the First World War, the government in 1939 refused to allow the stations to be used as shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel, and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids; but by the second week of heavy bombing the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940 about 150,000 a night slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less. Noises of battle were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations, but many were killed from direct hits on several   [ 57 ]    shelters never housed more than one seventh of Greater London residents,   [ 58 ]   Peak use of the Underground as shelter was 177,000 on 27 September 1940, and a November 1940 census of London found that about 4% of residents used the Tube and other large shelters; 9% in public surface shelters; and 27% in private home shelters, implying that the remaining 60% of the city likely stayed at   [ 59 ]      [ 60 ]   The government distributed Anderson shelters until 1941 and that year began distributing the which could be used inside   [ 52 ]    :190  demand caused the government in October 1940 to build new deep   [ 52 ]    :189–190 within the Underground to hold 80,000 people but were not completed until the period of heaviest bombing had passed. By the end of 1940 significant improvements had been made in the Underground and in many other large shelters. Authorities provided stoves and bathrooms and canteen trains provided food. Tickets were issued for bunks in large shelters to reduce the amount of time spent queuing. Committees quickly formed within shelters as informal governments, and organisations such as the Red and the worked to improve conditions. Entertainment included concerts, films, plays and books from local libraries.   [ 61 ]    only a small number of Londoners used the mass shelters, as journalists, celebrities and foreigners visited they became part of the debate on societal and class Most residents found that such divisions continued within the shelters, and many fights and arguments occurred regarding noise, space or other issues.

Although the stress of the war resulted in many anxiety attacks, eating disorders, fatigue, weeping, miscarriages, and other physical and mental ailments, society did not collapse. The number of suicides and drunkenness declined, and London recorded only about two cases of "bomb neuroses" per week in the first three months of bombing. Many civilians found that the best way to retain mental stability was to be with family, and after the first few weeks of bombing avoidance of the evacuation programs   [ 61 ]      [ 63 ]      [ 52 ]    :80–81 Glover speculated that the knowledge that the entire country was being attacked, that there was no way to escape the bombs, forced people to accept and deal with the   [ 62 ]    :118        Office workers make their way to work through debris after a heavy air cheerful crowds visiting bomb sites were so large they interfered with rescue   [ 61 ]   pub visits increased in number (beer was never rationed), and 13,000 attended at People left shelters when told instead of refusing to leave, although many housewives reportedly enjoyed the break from housework.

However, Dowding had spent so much effort preparing day fighter defences, there was little to prevent the Germans carrying out an alternative strategy by bombing at night. When the Luftwaffe struck at British cities for the first time on 7 September 1940, a number of civic and political leaders were worried by Dowding's apparent lack of reaction to the new   [ 68 ]    accepted that as AOC, he was responsible for the day and night defence of Britain, and the blame, should he fail, would be laid at his door. When urgent changes and improvements needed to be made, Dowding seemed reluctant to act quickly. The Air Staff felt that this was due to his stubborn nature and reluctance to cooperate. Dowding's opponents in the already critical of his handling of the day battle (see of Britain and the controversy), were ready to use these failings as a cudgel with which to attack him and his   [ 68 ]    was summoned to an Air Ministry conference on 17 October 1940 to explain the poor state of night defences and the supposed (but ultimately successful) "failure" of his daytime strategy. The criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the Air Council, and the of Aircraft and Churchill themselves intimated their support was waning. While the failure of night defence preparation was undeniable, it was not the AOC's responsibility to accrue resources. The general neglect of the RAF until the late spurt in 1938 had left sparse resources to build defences. While it was permissible to disagree with Dowding's operational and tactical deployment of forces, the failure of the Government and Air Ministry to allot resources was ultimately the responsibility of the civil and military institutions at large. In the pre-war period, the Chamberlain Government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort and, along with the Air Ministry, did not make it a   [ 68 ]     by   [  edit  ]   attitude of the Air Ministry was in contrast to the experiences of the World when few German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to the resources Around 280 t (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Most people aged 35 or over remembered the threat and greeted the bombings with great trepidation. In 1916–1918, German raids had scaled down in face of countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was   [ 69 ]    night air defence was causing greater concern in the lead-up to war, it was not at the forefront of RAF planning. Most of the resources went into planning for daylight fighter defences. The difficulty RAF bombers had navigating in darkness led the British to believe German bombers would suffer the same problems and would be unable to reach and identify their targets. There was also a mentality in all air forces that, if they could carry out effective operations by day, night missions, with the attendant problems for attacker and defender, could be avoided   [ 70 ]    air doctrine had stressed, since the time of Chief of the Air Staff in the early 1920s, that offence was the best means of   [ 71 ]   British defensive strategy actually revolved around offensive action, what became known as the of the To prevent German formations from hitting targets in Britain, the RAF's would destroy the Luftwaffe forces on their own bases, aircraft in their factories, and fuel reserves by attacking oil plants. This philosophy was impractical as Bomber Command was not technologically equipped at that time and would not be for some years. This strategy retarded the development of fighter defences in the 1930s. Dowding agreed air defence would require some offensive action, and fighters could not defend Britain   [ 72 ]   By the start of the war, and until September 1940, the RAF lacked specialised night-fighting aircraft, and relied on antiaircraft units which were poorly equipped and lacking in   [ 73 ]       [  edit  ]   article: of the   navigation   [  edit  ]         Map of Knickebein of the inaccuracy of for precise target location in a fast moving aircraft, the Luftwaffe developed devices and relied on three major systems:  Knickebein  ("Crooked leg"),  X-Gerät  (X-Device), and  Y-Gerät  (Y-Device). This led the British to develop countermeasures, giving rise to the of the ".   [ 74 ]    crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night or in bad weather. The Germans developed the short-range Lorenz system into the Knickebein aid, a system which used two Lorenz beams with much stronger signal transmissions. The concept was the same as the Lorenz system. Two aerials were rotated for the two converging beams which were pointed to cross directly over the target. The German bombers would attach themselves to either beam and fly along it until they started to pick up the signal from the other beam. When a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and began dropping their Knickebein was used by German crews X-Gerät use was limited to specially trained pathfinder crews. Special receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the bomber's fuselage. The system worked on a higher frequency (66–77MHz, compared to Knickebein' 30–33MHz). Transmitters on the ground sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute. X-Gerät received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot both visual and aural "on course" signals. Three beams intersected the beam along the He 111's flight path. The first cross-beam acted as a warning for the bomb-aimer to start the bombing-clock which he would activate only when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the equipment's clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released. The clock's timing mechanism was co-ordinated with the distances of the intersecting beams from the target so the target was directly below when the bomb release   [ 75 ]     Y-Gerät was the most complex system of the three. It was, in effect, an automatic beam-tracking system, operated through the bomber's autopilot. The single approach beam along which the bomber tracked was monitored by a ground controller. The signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment. This way the distance the bomber travelled along the beam could be precisely verified. Direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the crew on an exact course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by issue of a code word by the ground controller, or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop. Although its maximum usable range was similar to the previous systems, it was not unknown for specific buildings to be   [ 75 ]     counter   [  edit  ]   June 1940, a German prisoner of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein even though it was under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. V. who started an in-depth investigation which discovered that the Luftwaffe's Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones therefore began a search for the German beams. of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30MHz receiver to detect them. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. A subtle form of distortion was introduced. Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that widened its path, negating its ability to accurately locate targets. Confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe decided to launch large-scale   [ 76 ]   The counter operations were carried out by British Counter (ECM) units under Wing Commander 80 Wing The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals was a technique known as   [ 48 ]    beacons operated on the medium-frequency band and the signals involved a two-letter Morse identifier followed by a lengthy time-lapse which enabled the Luftwaffe crews to determine the signal's bearing. The Meacon system involved separate locations for a receiver with a directional aerial and a transmitter. The receipt of the German signal by the receiver was duly passed to the transmitter, the signal to be repeated. The action did not guarantee automatic success. If the German bomber flew closer to its own beam than the Meacon then the former signal would come through the stronger on the direction finder. The reverse would apply only if the meacon were   [ 77 ]    general, German bombers were likely to get through to their targets without too much difficulty. It was to be some months before an effective night fighter force would be ready, and only became adequate after the Blitz was over, so ruses were created to lure German bombers away from their targets. Throughout 1940, dummy airfields were prepared, good enough to stand up to skilled observation. A [     ] of bombs fell on these diversionary ("Starfish")   [ 77 ]    industrial areas, fires and lighting were simulated. It was decided to recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, lamps were used to simulate the flash of tram cables. Red lamps were used to simulate and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden   [ 77 ]    use of diversionary techniques such as fires had to be made carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing oil and water. The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were similar to those of the German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real   [ 77 ]       [  edit  ]     Loge and Seeschlange    [  edit  ]         Smoke rising from fires in following bombing on 7 first deliberate air raids on London were mainly aimed at the of causing severe   [ 42 ]   Late in the afternoon of 7 September 1940, the Germans began Operation Loge (after in Wagner's and Seeschlange (Sea Snake), the air offensives against London and other industrial cities.

Its hope was to destroy its targets and draw the RAF into defending them, allowing the Luftwaffe to destroy their fighters in large numbers, thereby achieving an air   [ 86 ]   Large air battles broke out, lasting for most of the day.

But their operations were to no avail; the worsening weather and unsustainable attrition in daylight gave the OKL an excuse to switch to night attacks on 7   [ 36 ]      [ 89 ]      [ 90 ]          Bomb damage to a street after an air 14 October, the heaviest night attack to date saw 380 German bombers from Luftflotte 3 hit London.

Around 900 fires were started by the mix of 415 short tons (376t) of and 11 short tons (10.0t) of incendiaries dropped. Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock   [ 91 ]     Loge continued during October. According to German sources, 9,000 short tons (8,200t) of bombs were dropped in that month, of which about 10 percent of which was dropped in daylight.

Hull and Glasgow were attacked, but 800 short tons (730t) of bombs were spread out all over Britain. The Metropolitan-Vickers works in Manchester was targeted and 12 short tons (11t) of bombs dropped against it. Little tonnage was dropped on Fighter Command airfields; Bomber airfields were targeted   [ 92 ]          Firefighters tackling a blaze amongst ruined buildings after an air raid on policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on London, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of   [ 93 ]   Kesselring, commanding Luftflotte 2, was ordered to send 50 sorties per night against London and attack eastern harbours in daylight.

It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped 3,984 mines, ⅓ of the total dropped. The mines' ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping   [ 94 ]    mid-November 1940, when the Germans adopted a changed plan, more than 13,000 short tons (12,000t) of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids. The London docks and railways communications had taken a heavy pounding, and much damage had been done to the railway system outside. In September, there had been no less than 667 hits on railways in Great Britain, and at one period, between 5,000 and 6,000 wagons were standing idle from the effect of delayed action bombs. But the great bulk of the traffic went on; and Londoners—though they glanced apprehensively each morning at the list of closed stretches of line displayed at their local station, or made strange detours round back streets in the buses—still got to work. For all the destruction of life and property, the observers sent out by the Ministry of Home Security failed to discover the slightest sign of a break in morale. More than 13,000 civilians had been killed, and almost 20,000 injured, in September and October   [ 95 ]   but the death toll was much less than expected. In late 1940, Churchill credited the are told by the Germans that 251 tons of explosives were thrown upon London in a single night, that is to say, only a few tons less than the total dropped on the whole country throughout the last war. Now we know exactly what our casualties have been. On that particular Thursday night 180 persons were killed in London as a result of 251 tons of bombs. That is to say it took one ton of bombs to kill three-quarters of a person ... In [World War I] the small bombs of early patterns which were used killed ten persons for every ton discharged in the built-up areas. That is, the mortality is now less than one-tenth of the mortality attaching to the German bombing attacks in the last war ... What is the explanation? There can only be one, namely the vastly improved methods of shelter which have been adopted   [ 96 ]    American observer Ingersoll reported at this time that "as to the accuracy of the bombing of military objectives, here I make no qualifications. The aim is surprisingly, astonishingly, amazingly inaccurate ... The physical damage to civilian London, to sum up, was more general and more extensive than I had imagined. The damage to military targets much less", and stated that he had seen numerous examples of untouched targets surrounded by buildings destroyed by errant bombs. For example, in two months of bombing, Power perhaps the largest single target in London, had only received one minor hit ("a nick"). No over the had been hit, and the docks were still functioning despite great damage. An airfield was hit 56 times but the runways were never damaged and the field was never out of operation, despite German pilots' familiarity with it from prewar commercial flights. Ingersoll wrote that the difference between the failure of the German campaign against military targets versus its success in continental Europe was the RAF retaining control of the   [ 62 ]    :79–80,174   in British   [  edit  ]         An anti-aircraft searchlight and crew at the Hospital 17 April       anti-aircraft in night air defences were in a poor   [ 97 ]   Few had and the underpowered searchlights were usually ineffective against aircraft at altitudes above 12,000ft   [ 98 ]      [ 99 ]   In July 1940, only 1,200 heavy and 549 light guns were deployed in the whole of Britain. Of the "heavies", some 200 were of the obsolescent (76mm) the remainder were the effective and (94mm) with a theoretical "ceiling"' of over 30,000ft (9,100m), but a practical limitation of 25,000ft (7,600m) because the predictor in use could not accept greater heights. The light guns, about half of which were of the admirable 40 dealt with aircraft only up to 6,000ft   [ 100 ]   Although the use of the guns improved civilian morale, with the knowledge the German bomber crews were facing the barrage, it is now believed that the anti-aircraft guns achieved little and in fact the falling shell fragments caused more British casualties on the   [ 101 ]    fighter aircraft were able to operate at night.

From 1940 to 1941, the most successful night-fighter was the Paul its four squadrons shot down more enemy aircraft than any other   [ 105 ]   AAA defences improved by better using radar and searchlights. Over several months, the statistics went from 20,000 shells spent per raider shot down in September 1940, to 4,087 in January 1941, to 2,963 shells in February   [ 106 ]     Interception (AI) was unreliable. The heavy fighting in the Battle of Britain had eaten up most of Fighter Command's resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with search out of [     ] but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control 10 Group 11 Group and 12 Group ).   [ 107 ]     Whitehall disquiet at the failures of the RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61% of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1%. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading   [ 107 ]    it was radar that proved to be critical weapon in the night battles over Britain from this point onward. Dowding had introduced the concept of airborne radar and encouraged its usage. Eventually it would become a success. On the night of 22/23 July 1940, Cyril Ashfield (pilot), Geoffrey Morris (Observer) and Reginald Leyland (Air Intercept radar operator) of the Interception became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using onboard radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off   [ 108 ]      [ 109 ]   On 19 November 1940 the famous RAF night fighter ace shot down a Ju 88 bomber using airborne radar, just as Dowding had   [ 110 ]    mid-November, nine squadrons were available, but only one was equipped with Beaufighters 219 Squadron at By 16 February 1941, this had grown to 12; with five equipped, or partially equipped with Beaufighters spread over five   [ 111 ]       [  edit  ]      [  edit  ]         Coventry city centre following November 1940  November 1940– February 1941, the Luftwaffe shifted its strategy and attacked other industrial   [ 112 ]   In particular, the West Midlands were targeted.

On 17 January around 100 bombers dropped a high concentration of incendiaries, some 32,000 in all. The main damage was inflicted on the commercial and domestic areas. Four days later 230 tons was dropped including 60,000 incendiaries. In Portsmouth Southsea and Gosport waves of 150 bombers destroyed vast swaths of the city with 40,000 incendiaries.

It hoped to destroy morale by destroying the enemy's factories and public utilities as well as its food stocks (by attacking shipping). Nevertheless, its official opposition to attacks on civilians became an increasingly moot point when large-scale raids were conducted in November and December 1940. Although not encouraged by official policy, the use of mines and incendiaries, for tactical expediency, came close to indiscriminate bombing. Locating targets in skies obscured by industrial haze meant they needed to be illuminated "without regard for the civilian   [ 94 ]    units, such as KGr100, became the Beleuchtergruppe (Firelighter Group), which used incendiaries and high explosive to mark the target area. The tactic was expanded into Feuerleitung (Blaze Control) with the creation of Brandbombenfelder (Incendiary Fields) to mark targets. These were marked out by parachute flares. Then bombers carrying SC1000 (1,000kg (2,205lb)), SC1400 (1,400kg (3,086lb)), and SC1800 (1,800kg (3,968lb)) "Satan" bombs were used to level streets and residential areas.

Hitler correctly noted that the greatest damage to the British war economy had been done through submarines and air attacks by small numbers of Fw naval aircraft. He ordered attacks to be carried out on those targets which were also the target of the Kriegsmarine This meant that British coastal centres and shipping at sea west of Ireland were the prime   [ 126 ]    interest in this strategy forced Göring and the Chief of the Luftwaffe General Staff OKL )— review the air war against Britain in January 1941. This led to Göring and Jeschonnek agreeing to Hitler's Directive 23, for operations against the British War which was published on 6 February 1941 and gave aerial interdiction of British imports by sea top   [ 127 ]   This strategy had been recognised before the war, but Eagle and the following Battle of Britain had got in the way of striking at Britain's sea communications and diverted German air strength to the campaign against the RAF and its supporting   [ 128 ]   The OKL had always regarded the interdiction of sea communications of less importance than bombing land-based aircraft   [ 129 ]    23 was the only concession made by Göring to the Kriegsmarine over the strategic bombing strategy of the Luftwaffe against Britain. Thereafter, he would refuse to make available any air units to destroy British dockyards, ports, port facilities, or shipping in dock or at sea, lest Kriegsmarine gain control of more Luftwaffe   [ 130 ]   Raeder's the intervention of Hitler—gain control of one unit but Göring would soon regain it. Göring's lack of cooperation was detrimental to the one air strategy with potentially decisive strategic effect on Britain. Instead, he wasted aircraft of   (Flying Command Atlantic) on bombing mainland Britain instead of attacks against   [ 131 ]   For Göring, his prestige had been damaged by the defeat in the Battle of Britain, and he wanted to regain it by subduing Britain by air power alone. He was always reluctant to cooperate with   [ 132 ]    so, the decision by OKL to support the strategy in Directive 23 was instigated by two considerations, both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy Britain's sea communications in conjunction with the Kriegsmarine First, the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent, and second, the conclusion British morale was unlikely to break led OKL to adopt the naval   [ 127 ]   The indifference displayed by OKL to Directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect. They emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure, or diverting strength, onto industries building aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and explosives. Other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather   [ 127 ]    further line in the directive stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible, but also to intensify the air war in order to create the impression an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations. Airfields became water-logged and the 18 Kampfgruppen (bomber groups) of the Luftwaffe‍ '​s  Kampfgeschwadern  (bomber wings) were relocated to Germany for rest and   [ 127 ]       [  edit  ]   the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Gerät beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency changes were introduced for Gerät whose wider band of frequencies and greater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when British selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Gerät .   [ 127 ]    now, the imminent threat of invasion had all but passed as Germany had failed to gain the prerequisite The aerial bombing was now principally aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but also continued with the objective of breaking the morale of the civilian   [ 40 ]    attacks were focused against western ports in March. These attacks produced some breaks in morale, with civil leaders fleeing the cities before the offensive reached its height. But the Luftwaffe's effort eased in the last 10 attacks as seven Kampfgruppen moved to Austria in preparation for the in Yugoslavia and Greece The shortage of bombers caused the OKL to   [ 127 ]   Some 50 Ju Stuka dive-bombers and Jabos (fighter-bombers) were used, officially classed as ("light bombers") and sometimes called ("Light Kesselrings"). The defences failed to prevent widespread damage but on some occasions did prevent German bombers concentrating on their targets. On occasion, only one-third of German bombs hit their   [ 133 ]          Liverpool city centre after heavy diversion of heavier bombers to the Balkans meant that the crews and units left behind were asked to fly two or three sorties per night. Bombers were noisy, cold, and vibrated badly. Added to the tension of the mission which exhausted and drained crews, tiredness caught up with and killed many. In one incident on 28/29 April, Peter Stahl of was flying on his 50th mission. He fell asleep at the controls of his Ju 88 and woke up to discover the entire crew asleep. He roused them, ensured they took oxygen and Dextro-Energen tablets, then completed the   [ 134 ]    the Luftwaffe could still inflict huge damage. With the German occupation of Western Europe, the intensification of submarine and air attack on Britain's sea communications was feared by the British. Such an event would have serious consequences on the future course of the war, should the Germans succeed. Liverpool and its port became an important destination for convoys heading through the from North America, bringing supplies and materials. The considerable rail network distributed to the rest of the   [ 135 ]   against were successful. Air attacks sank 39,126 long tons (39,754t) of shipping there, with another 111,601 long tons (113,392t) damaged. of Home was also worried morale was breaking, noting the defeatism expressed by   [ 134 ]   Other sources point to half of the port's 144 berths rendered unusable, while cargo unloading capability was reduced by 75%. Roads and railways were blocked and ships could not leave harbour. On 8 May 1941, 57 ships were destroyed, sunk or damaged amounting to 80,000 long tons (81,000t). Around 66,000 houses were destroyed, 77,000 people made homeless, and 1,900 people killed and 1,450 seriously hurt on one   [ 136 ]   Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale. The populace of the port of Hull became 'trekkers', people who underwent a mass exodus from cities before, during, and after   [ 134 ]   However, the attacks failed to knock out or damage railways, or port facilities for long, even in the Port of London, a target of many   [ 42 ]   The Port of London in particular was an important target, bringing in one-third of overseas   [ 137 ]    13 March, the upper Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed. All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were attacked. Plymouth was attacked five times before the end of the month while Belfast Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000   [ 138 ]   Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and   [ 13 ]      [ 139 ]   Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the port installations, but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by   The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying just two Ju   [ 140 ]   By the end of the air campaign over Britain, only eight per cent of the German effort against British ports was made using   [ 141 ]    the north, substantial efforts were made against Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Sunderland which were large ports on the English east coast. On 9 April 1941 dropped 150 tons of high explosives and 50,000 incendiaries from 120 bombers in a five-hour attack. Sewer, rail, docklands, and electric installations were damaged. In Sunderland on 25 April, sent 60 bombers which dropped 80 tons of high explosive and 9,000 incendiaries. Much damage was done. A further attack on the Clyde, this time at Greenock took place on 6 and 7 May. However, as with the attacks in the south, the Germans failed to prevent maritime movements or cripple industry in the   [ 142 ]          Firefighters at work amongst burning buildings, during the large raid of 10/11 last major attack on London was on 10/11 May 1941, on which the Luftwaffe flew 571 sorties and dropped 800 tonnes of bombs. This caused more than 2,000 fires. 1,436 people were killed and 1,792 seriously injured, which affected morale   [ 138 ]   Another raid was carried out on 11/12 May   [ 134 ]   and the Law Courts were damaged, while the Chamber of the of was destroyed. One-third of London's streets were impassable. All but one railway station line was blocked for several   [ 138 ]   This raid was significant, as 63 German fighters were sent with the bombers, indicating the growing effectiveness of RAF night fighter   [ 134 ]     of RAF night   [  edit  ]   at night was also now under threat. British night-fighter operations out over the Channel were proving highly   [ 143 ]   This was not immediately   [ 144 ]   The F.1 was undergunned, with just four .303in (7.7mm) machine guns which   [ 145 ]   to down the Do 17, Ju 88, or Heinkel He 111. Moreover, the Blenheim struggled to reach the speed of the German bombers. Added to the fact an interception relied on visual sighting, a kill was most elusive even in the conditions of a moonlit   [ 145 ]    Paul despite its poor performance during daylight engagements, was a much better aircraft in the night fighter role. It was faster and able to catch the bombers, and its configuration was also beneficial. Placing its armament of four machine guns in a turret instead of fixed forward it could (much like German night fighters in 1943–1945 with their   configuration) engage the unsuspecting German bomber from beneath. Attacks from below offered a larger target, compared to attacking tail-on, as well as a better chance of not being seen by the bomber (so less chance of evasion), as well as greater likelihood of detonating its bombload. In subsequent months a steady number of German bombers would fall to night   [ 146 ]    aircraft designs were in the offing with the then under development. It would prove formidable, but its development was   [ 146 ]   The Beaufighter had a maximum speed of 320mph (510km/h), an operational ceiling of 26,000ft (7,900m) and a climb rate of 2,500ft (760m) per minute. Its armament of four 20mm (0.79in) Hispano cannon and six .303in Browning machine guns offered a serious threat to German   [ 147 ]   On 19 November, John Cunningham of 604 Squadron shot down a bomber flying an AI-equipped Beaufighter. It was the first air victory for the airborne   [ 147 ]    November and December 1940, the Luftwaffe flew 9,000 sorties against British targets and RAF night fighters claimed only six shot down. In January 1941, Fighter Command flew 486 sorties against 1,965 made by the Germans. Just three and 12 were claimed by the RAF and AAA defences   [ 148 ]   In the bad weather of February 1941, Fighter Command flew 568 sorties to counter the Luftwaffe which flew 1,644 individual sorties. Night fighters could claim only four bombers, and lost four   [ 149 ]    April and May 1941, the Luftwaffe was still getting through to their targets, taking no more than one- to two-percent losses on any given   [ 150 ]   On 19/20 April 1941, in honour of Hitler's 52nd birthday, 712 bombers hit Plymouth with a record 1,000tons of   [ 150 ]   Losses were minimal. In the following month, 22 German bombers were lost with 13 confirmed to have been shot down by night   [ 150 ]   On 3/4 May, nine were shot down in one   [ 150 ]   On 10/11 May, London suffered severe damage, but 10 German bombers were   [ 150 ]   In May 1941, RAF night fighters shot down 38 German   [ 151 ]    the end of May, Kesselring's Luftflotte 2 had been withdrawn, leaving Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 as a token force to maintain the illusion of strategic   [ 134 ]   Hitler now had his sights set on   the invasion of the in June. The Blitz came to  and   [  edit  ]      [  edit  ]   20 June 1940, when the first German air operations began over Britain, and 31 March 1941, the OKL recorded the loss of 2,265 aircraft over the British Isles, a quarter of them fighters and one third bombers. At least 3,363 Luftwaffe airmen were killed, 2,641 missing and 2,117   [ 152 ]   Total losses could have been as high as 600 bombers, just 1.5% of the sorties flown. A significant number of aircraft were wrecked during landings, or downed by bad   [ 5 ]     of   [  edit  ]   military effectiveness of bombing varied. The Luftwaffe dropped around 45,000 short tons (41,000t) of bombs during the Blitz disrupting production and transport, reducing food supplies and shaking the British morale. It also helped to support the U-Boat blockade by sinking some 58,000 long tons (59,000t) of shipping destroyed and 450,000 long tons (460,000t) damaged. Yet, overall the British production rose steadily throughout this period although there were significant falls during April 1941, probably influenced by the departure of workers of Easter Holidays according to the British official history. The British official history on war production noted the great impact was upon the supply of components rather than complete   [ 6 ]   In aircraft production, the British were denied the opportunity to reach the planned target of 2,500 aircraft in a month, arguably the greatest achievement of the bombing, as it forced the dispersal of   [ 153 ]   In April 1941, when the targets were British ports, rifle production fell by 25%, filled-shell production by 4.6%, and in smallarms production 4.5%   [ 153 ]   The strategic impact on industrial cities was varied; most took 10–15 days to recover from heavy raids, although Belfast and Liverpool took longer. The attacks against Birmingham took war industries some three months to recover fully from. The exhausted population took three weeks to overcome the effects of an   [ 153 ]          A street of ruined houses in air offensive against the RAF and British industry failed to have the desired effect. More might have been achieved had the OKL exploited their enemy's weak spot, the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber targeted rail communications and the States Army Air targeted oil, but that would have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the Luftwaffe was   [ 6 ]   The OKL instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently), and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than   [ 154 ]   Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz caused enormous damage to Britain's infrastructure and housing stock. It cost around 41,000 lives, and may have injured another   [ 5 ]       [  edit  ]   relieved British began to assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941, and the RAF Air Staff used the German experience to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack, and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over   [ 154 ]    writers claim the Air Staff ignored a critical lesson, however: British morale did not break. Targeting German morale, as Bomber Command would do, was no more   [ 155 ]   Aviation strategists dispute that morale was ever a major consideration for Bomber Command. Throughout 1933–39 none of the 16 Western Air Plans drafted mentioned morale as a target. The first three directives in 1940 did not mention civilian populations or morale in any way. Morale was not mentioned until the ninth wartime directive on 21 September   [ 156 ]   The 10th directive in October 1940 mentioned morale by name. However, industrial cities were only to be targeted if weather denied strikes on Bomber Command's main concern,   [ 157 ]    Bomber Command did see German morale as a major   [ 158 ]   However, he did not believe that the morale-collapse could occur without the destruction of the German economy. The primary goal of Bomber Command's offensives was to destroy the German economic-industrial base and in doing so reduce morale. In late 1943, just before the of he declared the power of Bomber Command would enable it to achieve "a state of devastation in which surrender is   [ 25 ]      [ 159 ]   A summary of Harris' strategic intentions was 1943 to the end of the war, he [Harris] and other proponents of the area offensive represented it [the bomber offensive] less as an attack on morale than as an assault on the housing, utilities, communications, and other services that supported the war production   [ 159 ]    comparison to the Allied bombing campaign against Germany casualties due to the Blitz were relatively low. For instance, the of alone inflicted about 42,000 civilian  imagery and   [  edit  ]   converse popular image arose of British people in the Second World War: a collection of people locked in national solidarity. This image entered the historiography of the Second World War in the 1980s and 1990s, especially after the publication of book Myth of the (1991). It was evoked by both the right and left political factions in Britain during the when it was embedded in a nostalgic narrative in which the Second World War represented aggressive British patriotism successfully defending   [ 160 ]      [ 161 ]   This imagery of people in the Blitz was and is powerfully portrayed in film, radio, newspapers and   [ 162 ]   At the time it was a useful propaganda tool for home and foreign   [ 163 ]   Historians' critical response to this construction focused on what were seen as over-emphasised claims of righteous nationalism and national unity. In the of the Calder exposed some of the counter-evidence of anti-social and divisive behaviours. What he saw as the myth—serene national unity—became "historical truth". In particular, class division was most   [ 160 ]          Women salvaging prized possessions from their bombed house, including plants and a during the Blitz produced the greatest divisions and morale effects in the lower-class areas. Lack of sleep, insufficient shelters and inefficiency of warning systems were causes. The loss of sleep was a particular factor, with many not bothering to attend inconvenient shelters. The Communist Party made political capital out of these   [ 164 ]    the wake of the there was widespread agitation from the over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night there until the following morning. So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the Police were sent in to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Sir was replaced by soon afterwards, in the wake of a Cabinet reshuffle as the dying resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June   [ 165 ]   The "Communist threat" was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the stoppage of the   and   the Communist newspaper and   [ 166 ]    brief success of the Communists also fed into the hands of the Union of (BUF). Anti-Semitic attitudes became widespread, particularly in London. Rumours that Jewish support was underpinning the Communist surge were frequent. Rumours that Jews were inflating prices, were responsible for the were the first to panic under attack (even the cause of the panic), and secured the best shelters via underhanded methods, were also widespread. Moreover, there was also racial antagonism between the small Black, Indian and Jewish communities. However, the feared race riots did not transpire despite the mixing of different peoples into confined   [ 167 ]    other cities, class conflict was more evident. Over a quarter of London's population had left the city by November 1940. Civilians left for more remote areas of the country. Upsurges in population south Wales and Gloucester intimated where these displaced people went. Other reasons, including industry dispersal may have been a factor. However, resentment of rich self-evacuees or hostile treatment of poor ones were signs of persistence of class resentments although these factors did not appear to threaten social   [ 168 ]   The total number of evacuees numbered 1.4 million, including a high proportion from the poorest inner-city families. Reception committees were completely unprepared for the condition of some of the children. Far from displaying the nation's unity in time of war, the scheme backfired, often aggravating class antagonism and bolstering prejudice about the urban poor. Within four months, 88% of evacuated mothers, 86% of small children, and 43% of school children had been returned home. The lack of bombing in the contributed significantly to the return of people to the cities, but class conflict was not eased a year later when evacuation operations had to be put into effect   [ 50 ]     audio   [  edit  ]   recent years a large number of wartime recordings relating to the Blitz have been made available on audiobooks such as Home and War These collections include period interviews with civilians, servicemen, aircrew, politicians and Civil Defence personnel, as well as Blitz actuality recordings, news bulletins and public information broadcasts.
