[ 1 ]   In a written statement from 1946, Aflaq wrote "The Arab nationalists are socialists", hence "there is neither incompatibility nor contradiction nor war between nationalists and   [ 1 ]   Socialism in his mind was subservient to the unity and liberty, however, he did believe that fighting for Arab liberation and unity was the same as fighting for socialism, believing they were the same side of the same   [ 1 ]   The goal of the Arab liberation struggle was to fight imperialism opposing the and to fight for .

[ 2 ]   In the party's 1947 constitution it reads "socialism is a necessity which emanates from the depths of Arab nationalism .... Socialism constitutes the ideal social order [for] the ."   [ 2 ]   It should also be noted that the Ba'ath Party was founded in 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party, it became the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952 when it merged with the Socialist .   [ 2 ]   Later, in 1950, Aflaq defined socialism as "not an aim in itself, but rather a necessary means to guarantee society the highest standard of production with the farthest limit of cooperation and solidarity among the citizens ... Arab society ... needs a social order with deeper foundations, wider horizons, and more forceful realization that moderate British   [ 3 ]   A Soviet analyst on the subject of the Ba'athist movement noted "The concept of socialist structure [as it] appeared in the articles and speeches ...

[ 3 ]   In a published shortly after that decision was made, Aflaq wrote "If I am asked to define socialism, I shall not look for it in the works of and ."   [ 4 ]   The main cardinal difference between Arab socialism and communism was, according to Aflaq and Ba'athist in general, was the cardinal role given to nationalism .
