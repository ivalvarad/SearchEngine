As the advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the proletariat new class of urban factory workers who labored under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet  Communist  .

The revolution transferred power to the Congress of ,   [ 16 ]      [ 17 ]      [ 18 ]   in which the Bolsheviks had a majority. The event generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. Russia, however, was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois   [ 19 ]   Other socialists also believed that a could be the precursor of workers' revolutions in the moderate Mensheviks opposed Lenin's Bolshevik plan for before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as "Peace, bread, and land" which tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the World the peasants' demand for and popular support for the Soviets .

Lenin thus created the (Comintern) in 1919 and sent the which included to all European willing to adhere. In France, for example, the majority of the Section of the Workers' (SFIO) party split in 1921 to form the Section of the Communist (SFIC). Henceforth, the term "Communism" was applied to the objective of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern. Their program called for the uniting of workers of the world for revolution, which would be followed by the establishment of a of the as well as the development of a . the Civil (1918–1922), the Bolsheviks nationalized all productive property and imposed a policy named which put factories and railroads under strict government control, collected and rationed food, and introduced some bourgeois management of industry. After three years of war and the 1921 Lenin declared the Economic (NEP) in 1921, which was to give a "limited place for a limited time to capitalism." The NEP lasted until 1928, when achieved party leadership, and the introduction of the Five Year Plans spelled the end of it. Following the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks, in 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist (USSR), or Soviet Union, from the former .       giving a Lenin's democratic centralism, the Leninist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base; they were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to .

Marxism considers itself to be the embodiment of rather than model an "ideal society" based on intellectuals' design, it is a non-idealist attempt at the understanding of society and history, through an analysis based in real life. Marxism does not see communism as a "state of affairs" to be established, but rather as the expression of a real movement, with parameters which are derived completely from real life and not based on any intelligent   [ 27 ]   Marxism, therefore, does no blueprinting of a communist society; it only makes an analysis which concludes what will trigger its implementation, and discovers its fundamental characteristics based on the derivation of real life the root of Marxism is the conception of known as for short. It holds that the key characteristic of economic systems through history has been the of and that the change between modes of production has been triggered by According to this analysis, the ushered the world into a new mode of production: capitalism Before capitalism, certain working classes had ownership of instruments utilized in production. But because machinery was much more efficient, this property became worthless, and the mass majority of workers could only survive by selling their labor, working through making use of someone else's machinery, and therefore making someone else profit. Thus with capitalism, the world was divided between two major classes: the proletariat and the   [ 28 ]   These classes are directly antagonistic: the bourgeoisie has private ownership of the means of production and earns a profit off which is generated by the proletariat, which has no ownership of the means of production and therefore no option but to sell its labor to the materialism goes on and says: the rising bourgeoisie within feudalism, through the furtherance of its own material interests, captured power and abolished, of all relations of private property, only the feudal privileges, and with this took out of existence the feudal ruling class. This was another of the keys behind the consolidation of capitalism as the new mode of production, which is the final expression of class and property relations, and also has led into a massive expansion of production. It is, therefore, only in capitalism that private property in itself can be   [ 29 ]   The proletariat, similarly, will capture political power, abolish bourgeois property through the common ownership of the means of production, therefore abolishing the bourgeoisie, and ultimately abolishing the proletariat itself, and ushering the world into a new mode of production: communism. In between capitalism and communism there is the of the a democratic state where the whole of the public authority is elected and recallable under the basis of ;   [ 30 ]   it is the defeat of the bourgeois state, but not yet of the capitalist mode of production, and at the same time the only element which places into the realm of possibility moving on from this mode of important concept in Marxism is socialization vs. nationalization. Nationalization is merely state ownership of property, whereas socialization is actual control and management of property by society. Marxism considers socialization its goal, and considers nationalization a tactical issue, with state ownership still being in the realm of the capitalist mode of production. In the words of Engels: "the transformation [...] into State-ownership does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. [...] State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that   [ 31 ]   This has led some Marxist groups and tendencies to label states such as the based on nationalization, as .

Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is socialist The teachings about this society are called  Lenin,  the Rural Poor" ; Collected Vol 6, p.    Leninism is the revolutionary theories developed by including the organizational principles of Vanguardism and the political theory of imperialism. Leninist theory postulates that, with the strongly determined will of the Bourgeoisie to establish Imperialism socialism will not arise spontaneously through the natural decay of capitalism, and that workers by themselves, who may be more or less sedated by reactionary propaganda, are unable to effectively organize and develop socialist consciousness therefore requiring the leadership of a revolutionary vanguard organized on the basis of As a result, Leninism promotes a in order to lead the working-class and peasants in a the creation of a was outlined by Marx and Engels in Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of Communist  [     ] Lenin modified this position by changing the role of the vanguards to who were to hold power post-revolution and direct the national economy and society in developing world disposing of the Bourgeois dictatorship through Leninists seek to create a in which the working class would be in power, which they see as being essential for laying the foundations for a transitional of the towards communism (Stateless society).

However, the term "Stalinism" is sometimes used to refer to Marxism–Leninism, sometimes to avoid implying Marxism–Leninism is related to Marxism and  Maoism is a form of Marxism–Leninism associated with Chinese leader After de-Stalinization, Marxism–Leninism was kept in the Soviet Union but certain anti-revisionist tendencies, such as Hoxhaism and Maoism, argued that it was deviated from.

They argue that Marxist–Leninist states did not establish socialism but rather .

"But, the transformation — either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership — does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine — the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers — proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that      a       b      capitalism" in the Soviet M.C.
